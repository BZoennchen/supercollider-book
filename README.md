I discovered the world of algorithmic composition and sound design using code!
First I was interested in [Sonic Pi](https://github.com/sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi) as a beginners starting point to learn programming.
But soon I was hooked and I wanted to learn more about actual algorithmic composition and sound design, doing what I may be best at: coding.
It is the essential puzzle piece I was always looking for -- a strong connection between computer science and art.
I discovered [TidalCycle](https://github.com/tidalcycles/Tidal), [FoxDot](https://foxdot.org/) and, of course, [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/).

I'm very excited and want to learn more about the topic.
This book is my attempt to do so, nothing more and nothing less (for now at least).
To really understand something one has to pass through a grueling learning process.
One such process that works for me is called the Feynman learning technique:

1. Pretend to teach a concept you want to learn about to a student in the sixth grade.
2. Identify gaps in your explanation. Go back to the source material to better understand it.
3. Organize and simplify.
4. Transmit (optional).

This book is my attempt to follow that technique imperfectly.
Maybe, in the end, someone else will find the material useful.
