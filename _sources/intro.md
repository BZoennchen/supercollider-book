# Preamble

>What, if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: 'This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more' [...] Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: 'You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine. -- Nietzsche

## Lost Futures

In its early stage in 1990, *cyberculture* hinted at an innovative utopia of anarchistic collaboration and collective expression, where ideas, knowledge, and power are evenly distributed across a decentralized web;
The internet felt like a gift to humanity.
Its invention, however, was driven by destructive possibilities in the form of the fear of a nuclear Armageddon.
In 1960 computational power was residuated in large mainframe computers, and their power became a critical indicator in the arms race between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.
To improve their workload, sharing these resources via a network was key.
At that time, computers haunted our popular imagination as bleak tools of the cold war, which embodied the rigid organization and mechanical conformity that made the military-industrial complex possible.
Many people, primarily motivated out of curiosity and the belief to do something of worth, were involved in building the network and, finally, the World Wide Web.

>There was no 'Eureka!' moment. It was not like the legendary apple falling on Newton's head [...]. 
Inventing the World Wide Web involved my growing realisation that there was a power in arranging ideas in an unconstrained, weblike way. And that awareness came to me through preceisely that kind of process. -- Tim Berners-Lee

Ideas can be as powerful as new technologies, especially if they fall on fruitful ground.
The reaction to the cold war establishment, in combination with a firm idea of the internet, led to an ironic transformation.
Later it was further amplified by the Hippie movement of 1967.
After all, the roots of many tech gurus were a cultist environment promoting individual freedom, free love, drugs, and rock music.  
Thanks to their vision, counterculturalists and technologists alike joined together to reimagine computers as tools for personal liberation, the building of virtual and decidedly alternative communities, and the exploration of bold new social frontiers.
Even though the internet was never really free from power concentrations, it gave us a powerful image of a possible future;
a *fever dream* of an alternative structure of society.
But what happened to this dream?

Looking at the big cities in the U.S. around 1975, one can observe two groups of radical left-wing artists.
One group wanted to change material realities through collective activism. The other wanted to change people's minds.
While the first group embraced bureaucracy, hierarchies, and organizations, the second believed in doing away with all of those things and turning instead to small-scale technologies, LSD, etc.
But drugs without reason are like an escape kit without an instruction manual.

>Taking MDMA is like improving [Microsoft] Windows: no matter how much tinkering Bill [Gates] does, MS Windows will always be shit because it is built on top of the rickety structure of DOS -- Mark Fisher

Fisher argues that taking ecstasy will always fuck up in the end because the human operating system has not been taken out of dismantled.

In the end, this split was damaging because, in a communal system built around shared consciousness, people with charisma start to lead, and cultural norms kick in.
Distributing resources relies on negotiation and, thus, bureaucracy.
The collective drive lost its strength, and a mood of disillusion spread across artists.
They no longer tried to change existing power structures and material realities but critiqued the status quo via personal expressions.  

>It was the mood of the era, and the revolution was deferred indefinitely.
And while we were dozing, the money crept in.

One might argue that the communalist movement led to a turning away from politics.
It led us to the self as the basis of political change.
The missing component that was maybe necessary to realize the *fever dream*, that is, the democratization of social, economic, and ecological life, was the ability to negotiate.
Instead, the cultist disruption centered around giving power to 'the right' people.

We can observe the cultist ethos in today's *Silicon Valley*.
Most representatives of the IT industry argue against regulation on the promise of a new satisfying society.

>Do not stifle our creativity and we will build you new gadgets.

It was and is all about exceptionally bright individuals, tribes, and rebellions.
It was and is all about heroic stories of bootstrapped individuals pursuing conscious change.
It was and is all about power to people instead of power to the people.
Consider google, a company that treats its engineers quite well, offers flexible workspaces and has built a culture of collaboration and creativity that looks very communal (with the exception, of course, that workers do not own the company).
However, around those engineers, low-paid cafeteria workers who are making something very close to minimum wage, and often lack the ability to get proper health insurance, are exploited.
Thatâ€™s the kind of old communal mindset.
Bring together a kind of elite, give them a shared mindset and the resources they need to live in that mindset, and you can surround them with troubled workers.
Seemingly paradoxically, this elitism correlates with esoterism and cults because those people tend to believe to be special or at least to know something special, which can lead to a kind of fascism, i.e., the very thing those people should heavily oppose.

There is no question that this setup led to innovation and an incredible diversity of consumer goods.
However, did it lead to a better society?
Has the rise of information technology and the expansion of what was originally the military-industrial complex substantially improved our lives? 
The distribution of material, as well as intellectual goods -- the haves and the have nots -- are drifting apart, and the middle class is melting.

Today I realize that this tech explosion brought us an even higher degree of monetarization and commercialization.
We innovated like crazy, but we have not solved some of the problems of inequality and diversity that were core to the people of 1960.
Furthermore, the psychological effect of the colonialization of our literal time might be more catastrophic than expected.
Today we live in a business ontology in which the enterprise is the holy grail and entrepreneurs are our disciples.
The church lost its power, but our religious tendencies are still vibrant.
According to *Baudrillard*, the use value of commodities is over-coded by their sign value.
And those signs ('the code') can be exchanged like money.
I think *Baudrillard* has a point.
Objects and events are oversaturated with meaning and significance, while real but boring politics is stripped of any meaning.
News is no longer news but a presentation of interpretations and the interpretation and discussion of these interpretations and discussions.
Instead of looking at a situation without moralizing it beforehand and analyzing it carefully, we rush to simple stories and a clear distinction between good and evil.
Instead of living our political freedom (by voting, protesting, and revolting) our the freedom to discover and create, we celebrate the last freedom we seem to recognize: consuming.

The accelerating machine is brutal, exploitive, irrational, and completely out of control.
We have proposals from *Ruth Benedict* and *Gregory Bateson* who suggest that we need to build multimedia environments in which people can find themselves by selecting images and sounds from around them such that they can fulfill their individual destinies and thereby build a more democratic, less hierarchical, more egalitarian sort of society.
We spot ideas from *Norbert Wiener*.
At the same time, we can find a critique of hierarchy echoing *Margaret Mead* and *Erich Fromm* who pushed back publicly against fascism and racism and openly advocated for a sexually diverse America.
The tech-sphere still draws from contradictory concepts such as elitism, humanism, cybernetics, trans- and posthumanism, accelerationism, egalitarianism, eugenics, longtermism (a relatively new troubling trend), and of course, individualism.
Technological "progress" is seen as unavoidable, and the "objective" reality is confused with the measurable or observable.
Consequently, *death* is discriminated against because it has no significance within a *consumer society* of individuals.

And what about art?
I stand by the radical view that art can never be seen as innocent, grown from a world of money-making commodities.
Even if its creators could deprive themselves of that world entirely, the audience can not.
Money, as a stand-in for divine-like comparability, poisons art.
Moreover, capitalism drives us into a cycle of endless consumption and repetitive cloning.
Most of us can no longer create and bring out what's inside but consume what's in front.
Sure, there might be some short period in which something genuinely creative can emerge.
Still, soon after, its singularity will be destroyed by its assimilation into a sellable, thus quantifiable product.
Money is indifferent; that's the beauty and horror of it.

Through an ongoing process of decontextualizing, copying, alternating, and recontextualizing, this indifference creeps into all things.
That may be one of the reasons my reality feels thinner than it should be.
After all, indifference is the opposite of life itself which is all about differentiation -- bodies, cells, planets, cultures, and their environment.
Our *being there* (*Dasein*) can not be dissected and can not be understood by science because science breaks phenomena into pieces.
Science has to quantify and has to measure; it has to be blind toward *Dasein*.
Furthermore, science presupposes *Dasein*.
It is like time for which any articulation of what it is can only happen in time.
We need time to explain time, and we need *Dasein* to grasp *Dasein*.

*Bernard Stiegler* believes that many people live in *symbolic misery*.
He notes in *Symbolic Misery*:

>The question of 'culture', as it is formulated in its essence by art, is now more than ever at the heart of the economy, of industry, and of politics: the *sensible* community is today entirely fabricated by the *technologies* of what *Deleuze* called *control societies*; and it is essentially on this front that the international economic struggle is taking place.
 
The mystical aspect of the workers' life has no more place in a *control society*.
They can choose, but only from a set of pretty similar possibilities.
Nothing radical is in sight.
The horizon of what is sensible has narrowed down.
We are auto-regulatory and self-controlling;
Many of us feel empty, haunted by *lost futures*, and from time to time overwhelmed by nostalgia, while the *Rage Against the Machine* seems now unimaginable.

The university is one institution where we can observe this dissolution of diverse and critical thought, especially in Europe.
The *Bologna* process homogenized and instrumentalized the education system.
Today students do not learn to think but to be "productive" -- to reproduce -- and aligned in an unquestioned economic system of exploitation.
Universities of today teach emotionally detached students to remember specific rules such that they can apply them in the next exam to get a good grade.
It is horrifying that one of the most questions students in the first semester ask is: how will the exam look like?
Is this topic relevant to the exam? Students demand a list of actions they ought to do to get an A with certainty.
And they will cheat the system wherever possible if it will bring them closer to that goal.
Most students are not fascinated by the endless playground of reality. They are interested in something other than the experience of learning and understanding but in the final product, i.e., the certificate to get access to a well-paid job. 
Letâ€™s not forget that future teachers are the students of today.
By no means is this the student's fault.
They play the system of control that demands them to do so.
Moreover, if one resists the circuit, she will not be punished but filtered.
It seems impossible to depart from this school-like system since the new generation of professors grew up in it.
Nowadays, education is consumption.

The generation of 1967 and most of today's educators are perfectly aligned with today's consumerism. Consumerism is everywhere.

>People all over the world spend countless hours of their lives every week being fed entertainment in the forms of movies, TV shows, newspapers, YouTube videos, the internet. 
And it is ludicrous to believe that this stuff doesnâ€™t alter our brains. 
And it is also equally ludicrous to believe that, at the very least, this mass distraction and manipulation is not convenient for the people who are in charge. People are starving. 
They may not know it because they are being fed mass-produced garbage. 
The packaging is colorful and loud, but itâ€™s being produced in the same factories that make pop-tarts and IPads; by people sitting around thinking: what can we do to bring people to buy more of these? 
And they are very good at their jobs. 
But that is what we are getting because thatâ€™s what theyâ€™re making. Theyâ€™re selling you something. 
And the world is built on this now. 
Politics and governments are built on this; corporations are built on this; interpersonal relationships are built on this; and we are starving, all of us; and we are killing each other; 
and we hate each other; 
and we are calling each other liars and evil because itâ€™s all become marketing, and we want to win; because we are lonely and empty and scared. 
And we are led to believe winning will change all that. But there is no winning -- Charlie Kaufman

Our dreams, feelings, moments, culture, and intimacy are now open for sale.
To do business means to be at war.
Famously president J. W. Bush encouraged his people to go shopping more while waging an unjustified war in Iraq.
Recently he misspoke, calling the invasion of Iraq:

>the decision of one man to launch a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion of Iraq

Of course, he meant Ukraine.
It perfectly illustrates the absurdity of our consumer society. 
It also shows the difficulty of distinguishing between simulation and reality -- between constructed stories and myth and *the real*: a senseless, infinitely complex shadow of what we call reality.

One obsolete alternative that is getting more and more traction is fascism.
By telling the tales of genetic inferiority, fascism is one way to justify inequality and the annihilation of billions of people, facing the fact that endless material growth is impossible and many areas will become uninhabitable.
Right-wing forces are on the rise.
They can give the people, beaten down and affected by their *symbolic misery*, some short-term relief.
They can give easy answers to very complex questions.
*Fascism gets things done* is one of its appealing promises.
The phenomenon of someone like Trump might signify our desperate desire to find a story that makes sense of our realities.
People are thirsty; some want to push the red button of destruction to force anything different than the status quo -- any change is desirable, regardless of its destructive potential.
Ringwingers are sophisticated myth tellers.
They know how to exploit symbolism.
When Trump talks about *closed factories* scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation, his ghostwriters invoke a postapocalyptic image of desolation.
The factories signify the ruins of a once great civilization similar to ancient temples. 
As such, the *factory* is a *sign* for the loss of manufacturing, the betrayal of politicians, and the outsourcing of production to other countries. 
Whether or not this is true makes no actual difference to the signification of the factories as the *tombstones of American greatness*.
The power of the myth deforms facts such that they serve an emotional narrative of loss and ruin.
The rusted-out tombstone factories do not signify, as we might expect, factory production since production appears to be steadily increasing.
But let's face it: we are also living by a myth; the myth of the successful unlimited domination and exploitation of nature by technology and an economic system is based on material and productivity growth.

So, is it all over?
Is the end already baked into our current condition?
Is it time to give up?
Let it play out, and see how it goes?
As individuals, we are powerless.
And even if somehow some power structures push for a change, *system theory* tells us that the effect on the system can not be predicted.
We could find the last joyful moments in *hedonic nihilism*, but that seems just not enough.

There is, however, one thing outside of the realm of explainability.
It can not be dissected.
Nobody, and no machine, can measure it.
It is outside of demystification.
That thing is the being there in the world (*Dasein*).
As long there is *Dasein* there is something mystical.
It is our last stand against complete assimilation, an *indestructible sparkle of fascination*.

Even if we lack an alternative to the money-making machine and seemingly silently accept this "fact", a reinvigorated *cyberculture* might act as a reminder that, despite *Mark Fisher's* declaration, we can still revolt against *Capitalist Realism*.
The story politicians tell the everyday person no longer seems to reflect the reality they live in.
Reality and our model of reality no longer fit together:
Google and the cafeteria workers, the danger of ecological, social, and economic collapse due to climate change and the space exploring billionaires, more and more comfort yet more and more unsatisfaction, more and faster communication yet less social movement, more and more donations by billionaires yet more and more inequality, the phantasy of individualized high-tech underground car transportation systems yet no investments in public transportation, hungry people yet supermarkets packed with expensive stuff, homeless people yet the resources to build a home for anybody, and the list goes on and on.
I am not saying that these problems are easy to solve, and they are boring.
However, it doesn't seem that we are even trying.
Instead, we invent yet another gadget.
This discrepancy triggers a strange feeling; the absurd explodes into our faces.
Something is entirely off.
I hope that at some breaking point, our model accomplishes a radical recalibration and a new horizon of possibilities arises.

Is brutal exploitation of one another the only way to build and keep a society for some worth living in?
In the face of climate, ecological and economic disasters, we can no longer assume that endless material growth is a feasible economic strategy.
It never was, but now it is clear that it is no longer feasible in the short run -- the stability of the current system is just a fantasy.
However, we still act as if it is feasible.
Like the people of the late *Soviet Union*, we are acting as if everything is going according to plan even though the climate catastrophe is realistically unavoidable.
From this perspective, *Capitalist Realism* is not *The End of History* but a sign of a failing system that is on the brink of collapse.
It is evident that our *senseless consumption* has to end or at least slow down radically, but the system demands consumption for its own survival.
It is built on consumption.
To believe that we can somehow consume out of the disaster is pure madness.

To defeat a myth, I have two ways in mind: by second *Enlightenment* or by creating a better one.
Maybe we need a myth of our own, not only to push back against a fascist dystopia but to extend the horizon of the thinkable.
If there is only darkness on the horizon, lighting a candle can move the world.
Furthermore, art can be a place to start constructing or contributing to a new ideal to strive towards.

Disaster will arrive in our lifetime, but I still want to live my life in such a way that I welcome the demon forcing me to live it over and over again because I once experienced a moment of unimaginable, undescribable, and non-reproducible quality and beauty because I once truly recognized *the other*.
I doubt that acting negatively against the myth will break it because, in that case, we take part in the dialectic, which perfectly incorporates any resistance.
My unjustifiable belief is that the solution lies in creation and affirmation, not by criticizing without creating but by criticizing by creation.
This time it has to be a collective project that affirms differences.
Failing tragically seems to me much more appealing than being *comfortable numb*.
This pessimistic viewpoint sounds bleak.
But I think it is essential to accept the possibility of a *dying world* and to come to peace with it.
Not to flee reality but instead to be in it, more than ever, and to take on that fight -- to bring dignity, kindness, and love into a dying world.

## Technology and Art

>We might be in a collective state of existential crisis, but we are to busy to notice it.

Technology should not be trusted naively, instead we should think about it in depth.
Our general understanding of technology is inherently humanistic, that is, we think of it as something seperated from us; 
something over that we can rule; something that we can control perceisly.
From that viewpoint, technology is by definition something non-human.
It can be used for the good, the bad, the ugly, and the beautiful and we can decide what to do with it.
Nowadays this viewpoint is challenged by the advances in *artificial "intelligence"*, especially the branch of *machine learning*.
The line between controlling and being controled gets more and more blurred.

>[...] there is an idea that technology is in its essence something human beings have under their control. In my opinion, that is not possible. Technology is in its essence something that human beings cannot master of their own accord. -- Heidegger

Technology is neither inherently progressive nor repressive.
We must rethink technology as something that, like nature, is not strictly separated from us.
It is an extension of the human body and the human mind.
Technology shapes our way of communication and our material realities;
it opens up spaces of possibilities but, at the same time, closes the door to preexisting ways of life.

For example, the introduction of cars influenced how we plan and build cities and, consequently, possessing a car became mandatory in many areas.
Email changed our communication ethics at the workplace; it made the interaction with emails mandatory.
I see it as a privilege that my generation was one of the last growing up in an internet-free world.
Today, children are confronted with a world of spectacle distractions.
Their desires and their attention is channeled into the profit making fungus.

Massively widespread technology has this dictating ability -- once established, it dictates our way of communication.
It shapes our mundane life, and if we want to live within society, we can not escape it.
We live in an *age of disruption* where technology escapes any deep analysis because it evolves faster than we can blink.
Every-day people are busy.
They are constantly trying to keep up with all the news feeds poking at them, and it becomes hard to apply any narrative to their experiences.
They do not know what is going on.
They are just moving through their day, moment to moment.
It is a disorienting place to be.
Time slips away without any deep satisfaction; another day went to *Instagram*.

The danger is never to stop hustling.
We need spaces that help us not to escape but to **really** engage with technology!
To understand how it affects us, how it changes us, how it can help us and how it might destroy us.
Follwing *Martin Heidegger* there are two distinction we should make: the tools and techniques of modern science, along with all the gadgets created to add material comfort to human life, which he calls *mere technology* and the *essence of technology*, i.e., the structure of the technological world and our way of existing in this world.
Heidegger argues that if all we ever do is gain an increasingly sophisticated understanding of *mere technology*, the mastery of tools and instruments and the application of techniques, even those that indisputable improve our standard if living, without gaining an understanding of the *essence of technology*, our understanding will not free us but only further enslave us.

When talking about Heidegger one should mention that he was a Nazi.

>How is it that such a brilliant mind was taken
in by the Nazis? How could Heidegger be so socially irresponsible? It is the
same problem as with Celan: here is a wonderful writer who was a rotten
anti-Semite [...] I have shown Heideggerâ€™s brain with a mushroom-like tumor
growing out of it to make the point. -- Anselm Kiefer

We have to consider that his worry about *global technology* pushed him towards the Nazi Party in the first place.
The Nazis were opposed to the two dominant forms of government of the day that Heidegger associated with *global technology*, communism and democracy.
Therefore, to study Heiddegger is both dangerous and difficult.
It requires great caution and care to appreciate the depth and complexity of his thought, and to be aware of his association with the Nazis.

According to Heidegger, technology is revealing but at the same time it is concealing, an open space between paths, and a place where reality appears in a certain light.
The *essence of technology* (*das Gestell*) is its mode of revealing and concealing.
This means that technological things have their own novel kind of presence, endurance, and connections among parts and wholes.
They have their own way of presenting themselves and the *world* in which they operate -- technology is dominance and control.
However, the heart of the matter is not in any particular machine, process, resource, but rahter in the *challenging* (herausfordernd): the way the *essence of technology* operates on our understanding of all matters and on the presence of those matters themselves -- the all-pervasive way we confront and are confronted by the technological world.

The mode of revealing that holds sway throughout modern technolgy does not unfold into a bringing forth in the sense of *poiesis* (Gestalt), the revealing that rules in modern technology is a *challenging* (Herausfordern), which puts to nature the unreasonable demand that it supply energy which can be extracted and stored as such.
It is important to note that for Heidegger the *challenge* preceded the unlocking; the *essence of technology* is thus prior to natural science.
Modern technology is a distraction from our being-in-the-world (Befindlichkeit) which is always dependent on a mood that Heidegger calls Sorge, meaning fear, or worry, or care.

The nature of being-in-the-world is such that we never escape these concerns, but we often try to deny them.
We distract ourselves from our cares, the major one is death, and live inauthentically.
Our relation to technological tools, techniques, and gadgets can provide this distraction, taking us away from our more fundamental experience, luring us into a pseudo-security which is a danger if it prevents the lived awareness of what we ultimately are:

>beings in trouble in a world of uncertainty.

We get used to the internet, smartphones, social media, and other platform economies, and endless repetition of the trivial.
As an individual, we seem powerless concerning new technologies and we might sometimes feel this lack of depth provided by the scattered and disected.
The *essence of technology* robs us of experiencing *nearness* because to experience it, we must encounter things in their truth.
And no matter how much we believe that science will let us encounter the actual in its actuality, science only offers us *representations of things*.
An example from the second lecture illustrates what Heidegger means. 
Scientifically speaking, the distance between a house and the tree in front of it can be measured neutrally: it is thirty feet. 
But in our everyday lives, that distance is not as neutral, not as abstract. Instead, the distance is an aspect of our concern with the tree and the house: the experience of walking, of seeing the treeâ€™s shape grow larger as I come closer, and of the growing separation from the home as I walk away from it.
In the scientific account things become indifferent to our *concerns* (Sorge) by representing both the distance and the object as simple but useful mathematical entities or philosophical ideas, we lose our truest experience of *nearness* and distance.

Furthermore, functioning things lead to more functioning.
And if there is a market (built buy channeling desire, i.e., marketing), we most certainly have to get used to yet another technological phantasy.
Is it *the public* that wants to transfer another big chunk of reality into a *Metaverse*;
a virtual world based on a business ontology and governed by a corporate dictatorship?

I neither advocate for the denial nor for the embracement of technology in general.
I love technology and for most of us, rejecting technology is not an option.
We can, however, cultivate a reflexive understanding that enables us to see the way that reality is constructed by our increasingly technological worldview.

>It certainly is not a matter of condemning the industrial and technological fate of humanity. Rather, it is a case of reinventing this fate. -- *Bernard Stiegler*

Apart from the important distinction of *mere technology* and the *essence of technology* we also have to look at the material reality.
Who controls the production of *mere technology* and to what end?
I think digital technology is powerful and could likely solve the majority of humanities problems; 
from climate change to income distribution, sensor-based agricultural practice, food, education and the abolishment of racialization, gender discrimination, ableism and classism.
Digital technology can be amazing, but when all decisions about how to deploy and use it are in the hands of business people, then we have a problem.
These people implement a hazardous form of technological-driven society with the economy at its absolute center: a form of *digital / computational capitalism* where algorithms produce money instead of value.

We are no longer in a free market.
We are not in a place where the people have the same access to tools and technology.
They are no longer the masters.
When a young person has an idea, they automatically go to a money person because they think that is the only way to get their product developed.
Developers and entrepreneurs often start with a genuine belief to make the world a better place.
They believe their contribution will help the world in some way and be empowering, not just to them and their investors, but to some industry or consumer base.
But then they take money from problematic angles forcing them into specific actions.
At the stock market, business becomes gamified, i.e., companies are no longer concerned about their product.
Their mind is occupied with winning; 
*Bezos* versus *Sergey Brin* versus *Mark Zuckerberg*.

We have to ask:

>Are we programmers, or are we programmed?

*Meta's* customer is not the little girl using it to make friends.
No, it is the company that is buying the little girl's *social graph*.
Who is *Uber's* customer?
It is not the driver that it should be.
It is not the passenger, which it could be.
It is the shareholder, the investor.
*Uber* does not care about creating a decent, sustainable taxi industry.

We must critically analyze what each technology does, implying that we disregard the *neutral point of view*.
However, I do not advocate for returning to some naturalistic past, i.e., some lost authenticity.
It would bring only disappointment because such authenticity was never there in the first place.
Nature is a beautiful beast; it is the real that hunts us; it is us.
*Going back to nature* in the sense that we withdraw from working on landscapes, bodies and psychic systems are unfounded from a naturalistic ontological perspective.
There is no reason why we should not challenge its normative power, especially if constructed power structures are disguised as *natural*!

While technology is not inherently good or bad, it can never be neutral.
It is always based on some value and intention, and if we use a particular technology, we have to know what these values and intentions are.
Does this technology empower the right people?
Is it emancipatory?
How does it change our way of thinking, feeling, and communicating?
Is it helpful for us?
Who is controlling it?
What does it intend to accomplish?
Does it really work as intended?
What spaces does it open up?
Does it offer artistic potential?
What realities does it destroy?
I advocate for a culture of conscious engagement -- a society of aware agents within the realm of technology.
A potent society should have the power to reject technological advances in favor of cultural progress.

To understand technology, we have to understand ourselves.
We have to know how we can be manipulated, what is good for us, and what we need.
For example, we know that non-virtual social interactions are important.
It is calming and reassuring for human organisms to look into someone else's eyes, so to literally move into sync with another person.
Today we have so much communication without synchronization.
The communication is shallow and abstract.
We end up feeling empty and more exhausted.

>The 21st century is oppressed by a crushing sense of finitude and exhaustion. -- *Mark Fisher*

We live between emails, calendars, and *Zoom*-meetings, missing out on the things that really make us happy: talking to other people, playing with our kids, and giving love to others.
At the same time, there is always a *fear of missing out*:
Can I get in on this thing before it is completely gone?

What makes me optimistic about our use of technology are young people.
Even though we have an increase in suicide rates, probably due to the use of social media, I also observe more caution towards technology.
Young people seem to use technology much more appropriately because they are less fascinated by it.
They seem to understand that these big tech companies are not interested in improving their lives but in using them as vehicles.

I believe technology is always destructive as well as creative.
It disrupts existing spaces and opens up new ones.
Art, on the other hand, can highlight the open relation of *earth* (rock and stone, flood amd famine, birth and death, tools and technology) and the *world* (the cultural and historical horizon that reveals and conceals earth).
It can simultaneously gather them together, so to say.
In contrast to technology artistic works have many paths, they are more open in their revealing.
The work of art opens up paths, relations, and possibilities.
Art can open up the meaning of technology so that we might gain an open relationship to it.
For example, a work of art can reveal that we are not sure whether technology can be ignored or wehter it contains a seductive cosmic force that we cannot resist.

We must continually raise the question concerning technology.
I think it is not a question of complete resistance or complete acceptance but of studied ambivalence, calculated withdrawal, and watchful waiting.
Consequently, the artist's responsibility is to reveal and explore this process.
She is the one who creates aesthetic symbols -- a horizon of a possible future.
Neither being prejudiced nor playing the devil's advocate but engaging with technology and its masters honestly.
After all, the artifacts of our past are not given circumstances of nature but are invented by people.
But what happened and what will happen is guided by the horizon of the possible which is en-framed by technology and opened up by works of art.
We must disregard our automatic acceptance of how things are because it leads to a sense of helplessness about changing anything.
There is neither time for the bitter sweet melancholia nor the illusion that small local changes suffice.
Echoing the words of *Mark Fisher*: I am not worried about a zombie apocalypse, but I am worried that it is easier for people to imagine a zombie apocalypse than to visualize what life will be like in 10 or 20 years from now.
I am concerned that we have already given up, that we lack the imagination and courage to engage in the way that we really should be, and we will resort to reactions and seemingly easy but unreal solutions.

The digital is a critical factor in driving our pacification while we are looking into the abyss right in front of us.
So let us engage with it; 
let us be critical; 
let us fight back; 
let us sing a new song of technological empowerment of the people all around the world; 
let us reimagine our *cyberculture*.
Art might help to release us from the grips of technology by opening up a new path, a new awareness of our existence.

>Digital is not here to put an end to anything.
Rather it is here to expand all things, to combine and to make more things attainable.
For the artist, it is the edgiest work of all; the biggest, most exciting challenge in a long history of the synthesis between technology and hand and mind and heart. -- *J.D. Jarvis*

In the end, it might be the *energy of earth* that uncover a possible earth-world relationship.
This might be Heidegger's god, we are waiting and preparing for.

>Philosophy will not be able to bring about a direct change of the present state of the world. This is true not only of philosophy but of all merely human meditations and endeavors. Only a god can still save us. I think the only possibility of salvation left to us is to prepare readiness, through thinking and poetry, for the appearance of the god or for the absence of the god during the decline; so that we do not, simply put, die meaningless deaths, but that when we decline, we decline in the face of the absent god. -- Heidegger, Spiegel inverview in 1966
