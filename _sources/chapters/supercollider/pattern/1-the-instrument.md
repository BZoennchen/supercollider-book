# The Instrument and its Artist

In my opinion, there is no clear separation between the world of ideas and the world of materials and tools.
Philosophically speaking, our tools influence how we think about the world.
And our thoughts lead to new tools and new technologies.
Tools, like pen and paper, instruments, a hammer, programming languages or frameworks, and even our hands act as interpreters.
They translate our thoughts into actions that change the physical world around us.

However, this interaction is not a one-way street where we, the artist, enforce ideas onto the instrument.
Instead, the instrument influences our ideas by opening and simultaneously limiting our space of possibilities.
In fact, our brain does the same!
It limits what we perceive so that structure can build up within our minds.
Our brain is a complexity-reducing organ that generates reality by differentiation and abstraction.
The overwhelming stream of the concrete is filtered and enriched with meaning.
But all this happens automatically.
Before we start thinking about our brain, we use it.

In the realm of (other) tools, it seems to be similar.
Before we think about the being of a hammer, we use it.
Furthermore, a hammer is always connected to other things, for example, a nail or a wooden chair.
A tool or an instrument provides us with the means of expression. 
It defines the space of possibilities.
By limitations, it paradoxically opens up our imagination.

I think limitations are one of the most underestimated requirements for artistic creation.
If everything is possible, nothing will be accomplished.
Too much freedom can be a burden for the artist.
Without boundaries, the complexity of the concrete -- the language of the instrument -- can not be conquered.
If we can create everything, we become unable to express anything.
On the other hand, too strict limitations lead to repetition.
If the space of possibilities is too narrow, the artist becomes superfluous.
We encounter the great enemy of any creative process: boredom!
Consequently, there is no precise optimal amount of limitations, i.e., space of possibilities.
But changing the space from time to time can be a great source of inspiration.

To find out what space of possibilities you are looking for, I highly recommend to check out all available tools, and if none suits your needs, you may want to build your own! 
Building instruments to express ourselves is one of those beautiful acts a programmer can do!
Of course, we will always stay in some limited super-space of possibilities defined by the underlying machine we are working on.
We are limited by practicality, i.e., by things that can are *Turing-computable* in a reasonable amount of time.
If a computation consumes our lifetime, it is unpractical.

Now let us explore the space of possibilities that ``sclang`` offers.
