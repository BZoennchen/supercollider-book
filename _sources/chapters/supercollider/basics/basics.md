>Without music, life would be a mistake. -- Nietzsche

In this section, I will give a starting point so the reader can start experimenting with SuperCollider.
Before you move on, you should understand the content of this whole chapter -- it lies the ground for further discussions.
At the same time, I assume that the reader has some experience in some other programming language.
If this is not the case, you can still enjoy the text but might also have to look into secondary materials.

By only reading [The Ecosystem](sec-ecosystem) and this section, you have an excellent basis to start your discovery with the SuperCollider platform.
Together, these two chapters act as a quick start.

Before we go into the details, I must warn you: coming from programming languages such as ``Java``, ``C`` and ``Python``, the syntax of ``sclang`` is not the most beautiful.
However, this first expression hides the fact that many decisions regarding syntax make sense at a second glance.
So don't be scared by the first impression.
