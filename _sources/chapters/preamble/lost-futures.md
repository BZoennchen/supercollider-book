# Lost Futures -- A Romantic Response

>What, if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: 'This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more' [...] Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: 'You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine. -- Nietzsche

## The Fever Dream

In its formative stage around 1990 -- at a time of *postmodern culture* and when Fukuyama declared the end of history -- *ghosts of cyberculture* alluded to an innovative utopia characterized by extensive collaboration and collective expression, with ideas, knowledge, and power evenly distributed across a decentralized web; the internet was perceived as a gift to humanity.
However, the catalyst for its creation — the destructive potential of a nuclear Armageddon — foreshadowed its subsequent instrumentalization.

In the 1960s, computational power was centralized in large mainframe computers, the capabilities of which became a critical factor in the arms race between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. To optimize these resources, it was crucial to share them across a network. 
Given this context, it's no surprise that computers initially loomed in our collective imagination as ominous tools of the Cold War. 
They personified the rigid organization and mechanical conformity that underpinned the military-industrial complex.

Despite these perceptions, many people were driven by curiosity and a conviction that they were contributing to a worthwhile endeavor. 
These individuals played significant roles in constructing the network that ultimately gave rise to the *World Wide Web*.

>There was no 'Eureka!' moment. It was not like the legendary apple falling on Newton's head [...]. 
Inventing the World Wide Web involved my growing realisation that there was a power in arranging ideas in an unconstrained, weblike way. And that awareness came to me through preceisely that kind of process. -- Tim Berners-Lee

The opposition to the Cold War establishment, combined with a firm vision of the internet, prompted an ironic transformation.
The future seemed bright. 
Utopian visions of the future were prevalent, dreams that were later amplified by the Hippie movement in 1967.
The roots of many tech gurus can be traced back to counterculture environments that advocated individual freedom, non-conformity, free love, drugs, and rock music.

Guided by this vision, counterculturalists and technologists alike came together to reimagine computers as tools for personal liberation, community building in virtual and decidedly alternative spaces, and for exploring bold new social frontiers. 
Despite the internet never truly escaping from power concentrations, it provided many people with a compelling vision of a potential future; a fever dream of an alternative societal structure. 
But what happened to this dream?

## Ecstatic Individualism

One might contend that the fault lay in the Left's inability to take collective and assertive action.
Undeniably, some were actively working to reshape material realities through collective activism, while others focused on changing people's perspectives. 
The former group accepted bureaucracy, hierarchy, and organization, whereas the latter worked to dismantle these structures, advocating for small-scale technologies, the use of LSD, and so forth. 
While this anarchistic impulse might appear attractive, personal freedom in a tightly interconnected society either arises from collective negotiation or from individual dominance over others. 
Unstructured drug use equates to having an escape kit bereft of an operational guide

>Taking MDMA is like improving [Microsoft] Windows: no matter how much tinkering Bill [Gates] does, MS Windows will always be shit because it is built on top of the rickety structure of DOS -- Mark Fisher

In his final remarks, Mark Fisher asserts that reliance on ecstasy will inevitably lead to failure, as the human operating system has not been fully dismantled.

Ultimately, this division proved detrimental. Within a communal system founded on shared consciousness, charismatic individuals often take the lead and cultural norms begin to assert themselves.
Additionally, from a *materialistic* perspective, ideas don't alter material realities, rather material realities give birth to ideas which inform further matieral changes.
Reality takes precedence, our narratives about it follows.
Importantly, the distribution of resources calls for negotiation, which in turn necessitates bureaucracy.
The undemocratic impulse to free oneself from bureaucracy continually presents an alluring prospect to those committed to realizing their ideal version of a "good" society.
Consequently, the collective drive lost steam, leading to widespread disillusionment among artists. Rather than seeking to change existing power structures and material realities, they redirected their efforts toward critiquing the status quo through personal expressions -- as liberal vehicle.

Fisher wrote in an essay (2013) about this failure:

>The Sixties counterculture might now have been reduced to a series of 'iconic' -- overfamiliar, endlessly circulated, dehistoricized -- aesthetic relics, stripped of political content, but Willis’s work stands as a painful reminder of leftist failure. As Willis makes clear in her introduction to [her 1981 book] *Beginning to See the Light*, she frequently found herself at odds with what she experienced as the authoritarianism and statism of mainstream socialism. While the music she listened to spoke of freedom, socialism seemed to be about centralization and state control. The story of how the counterculture was co-opted by the neoliberal Right is now a familiar one, but the other side of this narrative is the Left’s incapacity to transform itself in the face of the new forms of *desire* to which the counterculture gave voice. -- Mark Fisher

One could argue that the communalist movement triggered a shift away from traditional politics. 
It redirected the attention to the self -- an existential move -- as the foundation of political change, aligning closely with the rising tide of neoliberal ideology, i.e. the liberation of the market from the state, and the Left had no answer to that.
Whereas JFK once spoke of *obligations* to society, Reagan and Clinton advocated for *personal responsibility* as the ultimate solution to numerous societal issues.
Not to mention that during this period, dictators, supported by neoliberal ideology and U.S. exceptionalism, subjugated their citizens in South America to "free" the market at the cost of material realities of normal citizen.

The missing component, perhaps crucial to realizing the *fever dream* of democratizing social, economic, and ecological life, was the capacity for negotiation.
A decentralized solution, entailing a restructuring of the communication network, seemed ideal. 
Instead, the cultish disruption centered on conferring power to the "right" people. 
But the question remained: who determines who the "right" people are?
Ultimately, the tension between individual freedom and communal unity collapsed under the strain of external pressures and inherited power dynamics.

## Today's Cults

Today, the cultish ethos is evident in *Silicon Valley*. 
Many representatives of the IT industry argue against regulation, promising a new and improved society.
Regrettably, this faith in doing good has fostered an anti-democratic mindset characterized by hubris. 
Simultaneously, a significant portion of the fragmented *working class* venerates their corporate overlords.
And the ones who are left behind and do not benefit from any of this progress, tend to the Right while liberals are mistaken to be "the Left".

>Do not stifle our creativity and we will build you new gadgets.

The cultish ethos has always been about extraordinarily talented individuals, tribes, and rebellions based on identities. 
It has always been about inspiring tales of self-made individuals advocating for conscious change. 
It has always been about power for individuals rather than power for the people.
One of the most powerful depiction of this ethos is given by a CIA recruitment video called *I am Unapologetically Me*.
An institution which destabalized and destroyed many democratic governments feels the need to brand itself as a supporter of free individual expressions.

The accumulation of power isn't always imposed; 
often, it is sought after. 
People have an innate tendency to strive for supremacy and often look for a figurehead to undertake the unpleasant tasks, to veil the harsh realities of our intricate world, and to deliver oversimplified answers. 
Consequently, the politics of *personal responsibility* can paradoxically culminate in irresponsibility. 
In a society where individuals are held entirely accountable for their successes and failures, there tends to be a reduced sense of collective concern. 
We take pleasure in picturing ourselves as self-sufficient and independent. 
However, the reality is that we are constantly rolling the dice, and we heavily rely on social services, industry, and most importantly, other people.

Cults reside somewhere between isolation and communal unity, fulfilling members' needs for a robust group identity.
Consider Google as an instance. 
It's a company that treats its engineers exceptionally well, provides adaptable work environments, and has fostered a collaborative and creative culture akin to a commune (except, of course, the workers do not own the company). Nevertheless, the low-paid cafeteria workers surrounding these engineers, who earn near-minimum wages and often grapple to secure appropriate health insurance, are exploited.

This reflects the old communal mindset.
Form an elitist group, furnish them with a shared mindset and the resources they need to live within that mindset, and you can surround them with an underclass.
This elitism, somewhat paradoxically, correlates with esotericism and cults, because such individuals often believe themselves to be special or in possession of exclusive knowledge.
Consequently, fascism, or any other ideology hinged on the idolization of a few individuals -- the very thing these individuals should vehemently oppose -- always looms ominously in the background.

Another example of this cultist tendency is the *effective altruism* movement, which seeks to maximize societal good effectively. 
The concept here is to optimize the well-being of others with mathematical precision, employing statistical reasoning. 
Instead of giving money to the beggar on the street, one should support projects with a broader impact. 
Sounds reasonable, right? 
Following this logic, one should amass or concentrate wealth to become an effective altruist — they call this *earning to give*. 
Instead of relying on collective "intelligence", effective altruists lean on their perceived "superior" wisdom. 
This may be effective in the short term, but it is undemocratic, betrays a suspicious mindset, breeds elitism, and prioritizes an unmeasurable future state over the present.
When will the altruist cede power to the people? 
Moreover, isn't it overly convenient to hide behind a speculated future? One could easily advocate brutal actions in the name of a supposedly better future.

Moreover, and perhaps most alarmingly, many effective altruists (and *longtermists*) covertly consider calculated rationality to be a superior source of wisdom compared to any other forms of thinking or intelligence. 
Even though some AI experts believe that statistical reasoning is sufficient to simulate human-like intelligence, there is no concrete evidence supporting this claim.
We remain in the dark about what *consciousness* truly is, and yet we appear to be on a trajectory where decision-making is increasingly detached from human *conscious* experience. 
In a world already so instrumentalized that we refer to people as *human resources*, this trend is deeply concerning. 
Relying exclusively on statistical reasoning for decision-making, that is, letting machines guide us into the future, would likely lead us towards disaster.

The *crypto movement* provides yet another example that seamlessly aligns with *effective altruism*. 
At first glance, the idea is compelling: a *decentralized banking system* designed to transcend national borders. 
However, beyond numerous technical challenges, this idea falls apart upon closer examination.
If we equate money with power and that power can no longer be centrally controlled, then power should be widely distributed - that is the promise. 
Yet, there is a significant caveat: for this to work, wealth must be evenly distributed among the world's population. 
If it's not, the entire system simply represents another form of power concentration. 
Regardless of the underlying system, what truly matters is more equitable wealth distribution.
And pseudonymization isn't the solution; in fact, it's quite the opposite. 
The idea that fewer regulations lead to a "better" society has been disproven time and time again. 
What really matters is the mode of negotiation -- whether it's central or decentralized, direct or indirect, fair or unfair, informed or uninformed.

The perils of power concentration are evident within both the *crypto* and *effective altruism* movements, as exemplified by the case of Bankman-Fried.
A staunch crypto enthusiast and advocate of the effective altruism movement, Bankman-Fried was once its wealthiest member. 
Today, he faces charges of wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy, and money laundering.
I am convinced that effective altruists genuinely wish to do good in the world; many people do.
However, their approach reveals a profound mistrust in institutions and the general populace.
Instead of seeking reform or leading rebellions, they attempt to infiltrate systems and wield concentrated power on an individualistic level.

## The Progress of Tomorrow?

Does the concentration of power and wealth inevitably lead to evil?
In an objectivly moral sense, most certainly not.
The consolidation of power, knowledge, and capital has undoubtedly sparked innovation and an impressive array of consumer goods.
The impact on societal welfare and the possibility to live a "good" life is less clear. 
This question cannot be objectively answered as it largely depends on individual values.
However, it may be worth questioning our concept of "progress" within the context of the *Hegelian dialectic*. 
In fact, our perception of this "progress" may only exist because we think *dialectically*.
Has the rise of information technology and the evolution of the military-industrial complex significantly improved our lives? 

As material and intellectual wealth becomes increasingly polarized, with the disparity between the haves and the have-nots widening and the *middle class* dwindling, we need to question our assumptions.
It is crucial, then, to challenge our presuppositions. 
Despite the relentless optimism of some who claim that the world is improving, much evidence contradicts this, even from an economic standpoint. 
According to many economists, poverty levels haven't significantly shifted over the last century. 
Moreover, we are hurtling towards greater inequality. Thomas Piketty contends in his extensive 696-page book, *Capital in the Twenty-First Century* {cite}`piketty:2014`, that there are two main drivers of this trend:

1. High-income managers leverage their power to augment their earnings further. Their income does not correspond to their productivity.
2. In capitalist systems, income generated through capital tends to grow relatively faster than the overall economy.

While the first factor might be more infuriating, Piketty thinks the latter is the more significant issue.
For me, inequality isn't about possessing luxurious items or globe-trotting. 
Rather, it's about meeting basic needs, promoting overall wellbeing, ensuring education for all, and diffusing power -- essentially, saving and fortifying democracies.

Is it truly inevitable that large corporations must be owned by a select few? 
Would society benefit if each of us owned a stake in the infrastructure for which we are accountable? 
If we held ownership, wouldn't we become more concerned with the methods of production, instead of hiding behind a dominant *big brother*?
How did our spiritual world "progress"?
What experiences are now possible and which are impossible?
Are we the Nietzschian *Last Man*, satisfied but blind for the wonders happening right in front of us. 

## Extreme Consumerism

Despite the presence of occasional rebellious elements, I have come to realize that the technological explosion has amplified the extent of monetization and commercialization in our society. 
We have witnessed extraordinary innovation, yet the fundamental issues of inequality and diversity, which were central to the 1960s' counterculture, remain unresolved.
Moreover, the psychological impact of our time's commodification may be more disastrous than we anticipate.
Today, we find ourselves immersed in a *commercial ontology* where the *enterprise* is revered, and *entrepreneurs* are treated as apostles. 
The church may have lost its power, but our religious inclinations persist, redirected towards the idols of our time.
According to Jean Baudrillard, the practical use of commodities is overshadowed by their symbolic value. 
These symbols, or *the code*, can be exchanged just like currency. 
Baudrillard's theory holds water in our current societal context. 
Objects and events are burdened with layers of meaning and significance, while tangible yet mundane politics are often stripped of their importance.
News has ceased to be a simple reporting of events; it has morphed into a cascade of interpretations and discussions about these interpretations -- reality is just to boring.
Rather than trying to report what was perceived, we are prone to simplifying narratives and clearly delineating good and evil. 
Instead of exercising our political freedom through voting, protesting, and revolting, or exploring and creating freely, we celebrate the last form of freedom we seem to acknowledge: *consumption*.

The machine of acceleration is ruthless, exploitative, instrumentally rational, yet broadly irrational and utterly uncontrollable. We have seen ideas put forth by Ruth Benedict and Gregory Bateson suggesting that we should construct multimedia environments where individuals can discover their identities by selecting images and sounds from their surroundings. 
This method, they suggest, can enable individuals to fulfill their personal destinies, thereby fostering a more democratic, less hierarchical, and more egalitarian society.
We also notice echoes of Norbert Wiener's theories of *cybernetics*. 
Simultaneously, we observe criticisms of hierarchy reminiscent of Margaret Mead and Erich Fromm, who vehemently resisted fascism and racism. 
They openly advocated for a sexually diverse world.
The tech landscape continues to derive influences from an array of contradictory concepts such as elitism, humanism, cybernetics, transhumanism, posthumanism, accelerationism, egalitarianism, eugenics, longtermism, and, naturally, economic, cultural, and spiritual individualism.
Technological "progress" is perceived as inevitable, and "objective reality" is often mistaken for that which is measurable or observable. 
As a result, *death* is discriminated against, as it holds no value in a consumerist society composed of individuals.

What about the role of art in all of this? 
Well the history of popular art is a history of capitalist production.
The unbridled power of creative expression built upon the collaborative framework of social relations has been slowly but surely subsumed by the same death machine that is now drowning the future of every human yet to be born.
I maintain a radical viewpoint that art can never be considered entirely innocent, given its origins in a world driven by commercial commodities.
Its manifestation is always shaped by its profit-oriented surroundings.
Even if its creators manage to isolate themselves from this world, the audience cannot. 
Money, which often serves as a proxy for divine comparability, inevitably corrupts art.
Moreover, capitalism thrusts us into an endless cycle of ceaseless consumption and monotonous replication. 
Most of us have lost the ability to create and express our internal realities; instead, we consume what is presented to us.
Granted, there may be brief periods when authentic creativity can surface.
However, shortly thereafter, its uniqueness is obliterated as it is incorporated into a quantifiable and sellable product.
Money is indifferent - a trait that is simultaneously its beauty and its horror.

Through a continuous process of decontextualizing, copying, altering, and recontextualizing, this indifference permeates all things. 
This could be one reason why my reality feels less substantial than it should be. 
After all, indifference is the antithesis of life itself, which is defined by differentiation -- bodies, cells, planets, cultures, and their environments.

And herein lies a glimmer of hope amidst the distraction, for our very existence, or *Dasein*, cannot be dissected and fully comprehended.
It is the final mystery that, hopefully, we will never unravel.
Since science deconstructs phenomena into their constituent parts, it is blind for *Dasein*.
Science necessitates quantification and measurement; 
it must remain oblivious to *Dasein*. 
Moreover, science presupposes *Dasein*. 
It's akin to the concept of time, where any articulation of its nature can only occur within the context of time itself. 
We need time to explain time, and we need *Dasein* (which we are) to comprehend *Dasein* (what we are).

The philosopher *Bernard Stiegler* believes that many people live in *symbolic misery*.
He notes in *Symbolic Misery*:

>The question of "culture", as it is formulated in its essence by art, is now more than ever at the heart of the economy, of industry, and of politics: the *sensible* community is today entirely fabricated by the *technologies* of what *Deleuze* called *control societies*; and it is essentially on this front that the international economic struggle is taking place. -- Bernard Stiegler
 
The mystical aspect of a worker's life no longer finds a place in a *control society*.
They have the illusion of choice, but only among a set of remarkably similar possibilities.
No radical options are in sight.
Furthermore, it is getting harder and harder to meet the general life expectancy that was planned for them.
Finding a stable partner, buying a home, building a family, the rat race expected from them becomes less and less possible.
The scope of what is considered reasonable has been severely constricted.
In addition, we've become self-regulating and self-controlling; many of us are left feeling hollow, tormented by the specter of lost futures, and occasionally consumed by nostalgia, while *Rage Against the Machine* seems now unimaginable.

One institution where this erosion of diverse and critical thought can be observed is the university, especially in Europe. 
The Bologna process has standardized and commodified the education system. 
Students are permitted to think, but only so far as it leads to "productivity" in an economic sense -- to reproduce and comply with an unquestioned system of economic exploitation. 
More often than not, universities today teach emotionally detached students to memorize specific rules so they can apply them in their next exam to earn good grades.
It's alarming that one of the most common questions from first-semester students is: what will the exam look like? 
Is this topic relevant for the exam? 
Students demand a checklist of actions guaranteed to earn them an A. 
If possible, they will exploit the system to achieve this goal. 
Many students are not captivated by the vast playground of reality. 
Their interest lies not in the experience of learning and understanding, but in the end product -- the certificate that grants access to well-paying jobs. 
And let's not forget that the teachers of tomorrow are the students of today.

This is not to blame the students. 
They are merely players in a control system that demands their compliance. 
We have ceased to punish. 
Instead, the network of machines now filters and channels the stream of desires and possibilities. 
It seems impossible to deviate from this school-like system since the new generation of professors was nurtured within it. 
Today, education equates to consumption.

However, it would be unjust to claim that this path hasn't been met with substantial critique and calls for adjustment. 
There is, indeed, mounting pressure, but the resultant changes remain to be seen. 
When the collective's wellbeing relies on the altruism of unelected individuals to fund their research and education plans, democracy is either under threat or merely an illusion.

The generation of 1967 is perfectly aligned with today's consumerism.
When I discuss consumerism, I am referring to developed countries that wield their power over the workers in the developing world, which suffer often horrendously.
Large buildings packed with luxuriant abundance of consumer goods, food, clothing, and -- most importantly -- symbolic signifiers were the primary landscape of the urban environment of the last decades.
Streets oversaturated and overcrowded decorated with bright and colorful store windows.
Glimmering illustrations, neon-light symbols, alternating smells, restless music, a meaningless mess merged into a psychodelic noise of symobls overdosed with meaning.
It is the magical negation of scarcity.

>Learn how to turn customers into fanatics, employeees into ambassadors, products into obsessions and brands into religions. -- Slogan of a marketing company 

Almost as an ironic joke, products are advertised with the promise of an escape from the hustle of our world. 
Advertisements showcase the absence of work, of overcrowded spaces, of individualized competition. 
Instead, they reveal our deep-seated desires for solidarity, communal togetherness, a connection with nature, the appreciation of rituals, the enjoyment of our bodies, acceptance of our inner beasts, and our ability to create. Often, products completely disappear from their advertisements. 
You could watch ads for a car or a snack brand and hardly discern any difference. 
They project images of warm hugs, soft lighting, blurred focus, and sentimental piano music in the background. 
Advertising has morphed into world-building. It acknowledges that the consumer is aware of their embedment in consumerism. 
Advertising is now the fabrication of a world devoid of capitalism. No one is working, no one is stressed, and everyone seems to have ample time to hang out, work on personal projects, and share hugs. Advertising "sells" products it can't actually offer: quality time with our family, love, the freedom to work on creative projects, freedom from anxiety, freedom from conformity, and acceptance by others. 
None of these are truly available for purchase, particularly because the primary reason we lack these things (at least in the depicted capacity) is due to the limited freedom within most work settings. 
Products are now viewed as portals to an alternate reality. 

With our current world reaching the brink of its limits, new frontiers beyond Earth must be established, whether in the form of a *Metaverse* or another planet.
Becoming a crypto investor is to escape the status quo that has overcoded the Earth by going into space.
Here's the punchline: McDonald's, Apple, Gucci, BMW, and cryptocurrency evangelists are all marketing the same product that communism does - the eradication of alienation.

>People all over the world spend countless hours of their lives every week being fed entertainment in the forms of movies, TV shows, newspapers, YouTube videos, the internet. 
And it is ludicrous to believe that this stuff doesn’t alter our brains. 
And it is also equally ludicrous to believe that, at the very least, this mass distraction and manipulation is not convenient for the people who are in charge. People are starving. 
They may not know it because they are being fed mass-produced garbage. 
The packaging is colorful and loud, but it’s being produced in the same factories that make pop-tarts and IPads; by people sitting around thinking: what can we do to bring people to buy more of these? 
And they are very good at their jobs. 
But that is what we are getting because that’s what they’re making. They’re selling you something. 
And the world is built on this now. 
Politics and governments are built on this; corporations are built on this; interpersonal relationships are built on this; and we are starving, all of us; and we are killing each other; 
and we hate each other; 
and we are calling each other liars and evil because it’s all become marketing, and we want to win; because we are lonely and empty and scared. 
And we are led to believe winning will change all that. But there is no winning -- Charlie Kaufman

To keep the machine running, capitalism needs desires that it can satisfy.
Therefore, it has to channel desires into products.
But desire is not only something that is just there.
It is also something that has to be produced.
While capital organizes the flows of energy for the *desiring machine*, desiring control machanisms (fueled by capital) establish new frontiers to conquer.
And one of the frontiers is, of course, the *unconscious*;
a discovery established by *Edward Bernays* in his book *Propaganda* and later further analysed in his essay *The Engineering of Consent*.

>To understand a stable citizen, you have to know that modern man quite often tries to work off his frustrations by spending on self-sought gratification. Modern man is internally ready to fulfill his self-image, by purchasing products which compliment it. -- Ernest Dichter (psychologist and marketing expert)

In our system, the generation and guidance of desire is far more influential than any metaphysical, ethical, or virtuous principle. 
Advertisements carry political weight, occupying the realm of possibilities and, as Niklas Luhmann suggests, constructing a shared world about which we can converse. Despite the aesthetic being immaculate, wholesome, and filled with stylized settings and individuals, the underlying structure persists in its severity. 
The sick, the sullied, the misaligned, and the existential dread of our *Dasein* are consistently excluded at every level.

In my country, the Right is currently gaining traction due to an increase in immigration and some minor regulations geared towards a better energy mix. 
If a minor shift leads to a right-wing drift, what will transpire when more devastating effects take hold? 
The Right can offer people, battered and affected by their *symbolic misery*, a short-term respite -- another outlet, apart from consumption, to vent their frustrations.

The rise of someone like Trump, the quintessential postmodern president, might reflect our desperate underlying desire to find a narrative that makes sense of our realities. 
It suggests an urge to identify cracks in postmodernity and wield a hammer against the unseen glass. 
People are desperate for change, and some would willingly push a *red button of destruction* to force anything different from the status quo -- any change is desirable, irrespective of its destructive potential.

Similar to advertisement, right-wingers produce desire and channel dreams about a leftwing utopia into a nationalistic mystical past.
They understand how to manipulate symbolism. 
When Trump talks about *closed factories scattered like tombstones across our nation*, his speechwriters conjure a post-apocalyptic image of desolation. 
These factories represent *the ruins of a once-great civilization*, akin to ancient temples. 
Thus, the *factory* becomes a symbol of the loss of manufacturing jobs, the betrayal by politicians, and the outsourcing of production overseas. 
Whether or not this is accurate makes no actual difference to the symbolic representation of the factories as the *tombstones of American greatness*.
The power of the myth contorts facts to support an emotional narrative of *loss and ruin*. 
The *rusted-out tombstone factories* do not symbolize factory production as one might expect, especially since production seems to be steadily increasing. 
Instead, they encode the *greatness of America and its people*. 
And since this greatness is a feature of the past, it can only signify a *white greatness*.

While we might scoff at this logic, we must confront the truth: we are also living by a myth -- the myth of unlimited domination and exploitation of nature by technology, underpinned by an economic system predicated on endless material and productivity growth.

## Sparks of the Real

Mark Fisher conceived the term *Capitalist Realism* to communicate our belief that capitalism is the only feasible economic and political system. 
As a cultural critic, he posits that this view is reflected in our popular culture, with examples found in films like Blade Runner 2049, Children of Men, The Road, Scarface, Goodfellas, The Irishman, Killing Them Softly, and in music genres such as gangster rap and hip-hop. 
In these pop-cultural works, the protagonists fully comprehend the underlying system and conclude that it is precisely how it needs to be. 
The key to advancement in this dystopian society, as often portrayed in rap songs, lies in this understanding -- there are no more *Star Trek-like futures* depicted in the mainstream.

Furthermore, the ideas depicted in these movies are echoes from our past that continue to haunt us. 
They embody a kind of nostalgia for the future -- our lost futures -- because we have surrendered our ability to envision a different one. 
Flying cars, androids, and robots are visions from the 1950s - 1970s, which prompts the question: where are the fresh ideas? 
To illustrate Fisher's point, consider the top-grossing movies of 2019: Avengers: Endgame, The Lion King, Frozen II, Toy Story 4, Captain Marvel, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, Spider-Man: Far From Home, Aladdin, Joker, It: Chapter Two.

>21st century culture is 20th century culture in high definition. -- Mark Fisher

Fisher also rightly critiques some anti-capitalist movements.
These movements tend to either dismiss present suffering while awaiting a future revolution or commodify themselves, allowing us to fulfil our anti-capitalist desires (catharsis) through consumption. 
By purchasing anti-capitalist goods, we can dissociate ourselves, comfortably buying our way out of tension. What initially threatens the system is reabsorbed back into it.

Despite Mark Fisher's declaration, the impending arrival of *the real* could incite our rebellion against *Capitalist Realism*. 
*The real* seeps through the facade, and it's becoming increasingly difficult to ignore. 
It's not only that the narratives we tell ourselves no longer seem to resonate with the daily reality of ordinary people, but also that the mounting glitches fuel a desire that could be harnessed. 
Our perception of reality no longer aligns with reality itself: Google versus the cafeteria workers, the impending ecological, social, and economic collapse due to climate change versus space-exploring billionaires, rising comfort yet increasing dissatisfaction, more rapid yet less meaningful communication, increasing philanthropy from billionaires yet widening inequality, the fantasy of individualized high-tech underground transportation systems versus the lack of investment in public transportation, hunger in the face of supermarkets overflowing with expensive products -- the list goes on. 
The stark disparity between the newest consumer gadget and people begging for food elicits a peculiar sensation; the absurdity is glaring. 
Something is fundamentally askew.

However, in a climate of uncertainty, populations are especially deceptive to propaganda and I deeply fear a right-wing rise in the near future.
Let me quote some passages from the declassified document *Proposed PP Program, Stage Two* -- a manual to "remove covertly, and without bloodshed if possible, the menace of the present communist-controlled government of Guatemala [and] to install and sustain, covertly, a pro-US government".
I think we can easily spot these old tatics in today's propaganda.
Note that there was never a communist-controlled government in Guatemala.

>[Under] Political Followers [the] General Approch [is to]:
>
>1. create serious worry and fear about personal economic situations
>2. create feeling that followers' political collaboration is cause of their dire economic prospects
>3. offer choice between collaboration and misery vs. change political attutude, and prosperity
>4. offer choice between collaboration and punishment vs. change political attitude, forgiveness, and prosperity
>
>[And to the masses the general approach is] principally emotional, supersitious, non-rational propaganda.
>[...] *mass propaganda* plays on the *sub-conscious*.
>
>Mass propaganda deals with principally non-political subjects, such as weather, harvests, natural phenomena, omens, customs, etc.
>It attempts to disrupt people's sense of what is established and certain; it attempts to make the world look shadowy, unsure and foreboding.
>It may make a sharp, direct attack; it may deal in veiled allusions; it may be **deliberately self-contradictory**; it may be outlandish.
>Mass propaganda must be most closely geared to the moment, to the moods, habits, topics of public interest and customs prevailing at the time it is put out.
>**Rumor** plays a major part in mass propaganda.

With today's technology, widespread propaganda is not only feasible, but it can also be individualized and massively targeted. 
As this openly accessible document demonstrates, the problem isn't a lack of information, but rather an excess of it.
The purpose of propaganda isn't to make people believe it.
Its aim is to foster cynicism to the point where we no longer know what to believe, leading us to the assumption that nothing is true, no facts are dependable, and the world is merely a battlefield of partisan ideologies. 
In such a world, truth gives way to success as the value to be pursued. The focus shifts to achieving victory, regardless of the cost.
I believe Hannah Arendt was right about this.

>The aim of totalitarian education has never been to instill convictions but to destroy the capacity to form any. -- Hannah Arendt

Combating propaganda becomes challenging because an influx of information often fuels it.
Regardless, I don't have a precise solution, only a call for awareness and, perhaps, the enlistment of our bombarded minds.

## Rebellion of Makers 

So, is it all over? 
Is the end already predetermined by our current situation, as *accelerists* suggest? 
Is it time to surrender, let capitalism unfold to its final conclusion, and witness the outcome? 
As individuals, we seem powerless. 
And even if some power structures managed to instigate change, *systems theory* suggests that the effects on the system cannot be predicted, assuming our planet, with all its life and environments, constitutes an *open complex system*.
We could capitulate, finding fleeting pleasure in *hedonic nihilism*, but that seems insufficient.

My response echoes Nietzsche, and I fully acknowledge the looming danger within his writings and the abusive application of his paradoxical thoughts to fit a toxic self-help industry.
I also recognize the tension between Nietzsche's *superman* and my critique of *elitism* and the Right. 
I am a thief, pilfering those concepts I find valuable. 
For instance, *life affirmation* as a guiding principle, morality as a *dangerous virus*, the *body* being equally important and enjoyable and inseparable from the mind, the *significance of power*, and constantly *overcoming oneself* are lessons I borrow from Nietzsche. 
To alter our *complex system*, we must change or disrupt the *flow of energy*. 
Rather than investing significant energy into moralizing (without material impact), we should seek power and use it to adjust the *flow*, either by redirecting desires or by reducing the intensity of the established *desire machine*.

>[In the speech] MLK talked about the fallacy that certain Christians misunderstood love as a seeding of power, and then Nietzsche came along and rejected Christian morality because he thought it denied someone's vitality, the will to power in a healthy sense. MLK said, 'love without power is sentimental and anemic, and power without love is abusive and corrosive'. I want the left to have [this] Machiavelli[an-side] so that we can have the strategy, ruthlessness, and clarity to actually win these battles and be ruthless with institutions. And then I want us to learn how to be really kind to each other, welcoming of a broad set, and actually have a movement that has the capacity to do that. -- Micheal Brooks

There is a lot unfolding currently. 
Numerous grassroots movements have sprouted in the past decade, each envisaging a fresh future and forging their unique values.
On that topic, Western people can learn a lot from the people of South American countries.
Importantly, they appear to have learned from past missteps, understanding the need for collective action and an inclusive environment. 
Thus, perhaps there is potential for a reinvigorated *cyberculture*.
However, we must begin to reveal, critique, and leverage the production and channeling of desire more explicitly.
We all acknowledge that advertisement is *deceptive*, but such an underestimation significantly undermines its influence.

Does exploitation of one another stand as the sole means of constructing and maintaining a society worth living in? 
Is competition and fear the only path to productivity? 
Perhaps, if we retain the hierarchical structure of our society. 
However, with today's technology, we can establish diverse forms of governance. 
Here, I find common ground with crypto enthusiasts. 
I believe that behavior is partly a byproduct of the underlying system, in that a society steeped in suspicion necessitates competition, while a society anchored in trust fosters collaboration.

In the face of impending climate, ecological, and economic disasters, it has become clear that endless material growth is not a sustainable economic strategy. 
Although it never truly was, the illusion of its feasibility has now been shattered (by the desire machine itself). 
The supposed stability of the current system is merely a fantasy, yet we continue to operate as though it is viable. 
Much like the people of the late Soviet Union, we persist in acting as if everything is proceeding according to plan, despite the reality of ongoing climate catastrophes and the looming inevitability of more to come. 
Viewed from this perspective, *Capitalist Realism* is not *The End of History* but an indicator of a faltering system teetering on the brink of collapse. 
It is apparent that our rampant over-consumption must be curtailed dramatically, yet the system's survival depends on continuous consumption -- it is, in essence, built upon it. 
The notion that we can consume our way out of disaster is sheer lunacy.

In my mind, there are two potential strategies to dismantle the myth of infinite growth: a *second Enlightenment*, which seems highly improbable, and the crafting of a more compelling myth -- that is, the *re-direction of desire*. 
We need a myth of our own, not only to resist a fascist dystopia but also to broaden the scope of conceivable possibilities. 
If the horizon holds nothing but darkness, the simple act of lighting a candle can revolutionize the world.
But upon further reflection, I again realize that ideas alone can't alter material realities.
Perhaps the best we can do is prepare for these inevitable changes.

As previously stated, various unrecognized movements are already crafting vibrant visions of the future, a prospect that is truly heartening. 
Additionally, art can serve as a platform for constructing and contributing to these emerging utopian futures towards which we can strive.
It can also reveal truths buried under information (and meaning).
(Of course, art can also be an ally of the devil.)
In particular, musical performances can ignite the *Dionysian* flame, a counterforce to a calculating *Apollonian* worldview.

>Music, if regarded as an expression of the world, is in the highest degree a universal language that is even related to the universality of concepts much as those are related to particular things. Yet its universality is by no means that empty universality of abstraction. -- Schopenhauer

Enthusiasm, decadence, instinct, chaotic emotions, sexuality, and ecstasy shatter the boundaries of the conceivable by revealing the beauty of the tragedy in which we are all entwined -- that is, the beauty and mystery of life or *Dasein* itself. 
Music can expose existential tensions and the paradoxical beauty of the complex perversity of erotic desire; elements which our culture is so eager to conceal. 
As Jeff Baker, an ethnomusicologist, writes:

>Music like dancehall and funkarioca celebrate a 'slackness'.  -- Jeff Baker

Here, he is referring to the moral and political apathy associated with these genres and the sensuous, body-focused dancing that the music inspires, often simulating intimate acts. 
This *slackness* transgresses not only political and moral ideologies, regardless of whether they lean more radical or reactionary, but also confronts colonialist and capitalist attitudes, just as it does progressive and socialistic ones.

*Capitalism Realism* must crack; we have no choice but to transcend the polarizing dichotomies in which we find ourselves so entrenched. 
We can initiate this from positions that embrace a more holistic view of what it means to be human and what it means to create social structures that value the totality of our needs and our dignity as human beings.

At the root of most conflicts between art and socialism and capitalism is a lack of attention to the nuances that define the human condition, or *Dasein*.
The tension between freedom and state control, individuality and the need for community, and the desire to love others versus the temptation for self-gratification, are often glossed over by both individualistic and collectivist *metanarratives*, i.e., universal truths.

We are in need of spaces where these tensions can be expressed openly, without reduction or oversimplification.
Above all, we need environments where paradoxes -- like freedom and obedience, or aesthetic/metaphysical goods and political ones -- can exist without downplaying or dismissing any of the conflicting elements they encompass.

>Every living thing needs to be surrounded by an atmosphere, a mysterious circle of mist;
>if one robs it of this veil, if one condemns religion, an art, a genius to orbit a star without an atmosphere;
>then one should not wonder about its rapidly becoming withered; hard and barren. -- Nietzsche

Technocrats often display benevolence towards underprivileged people. 
However, if their actions are successful, they could potentially sever these individuals' connections to their communities, their lived traditions and art, and their sense of place. 
In this sense, they promote an anti-culture that further atomizes us, making us susceptible to the influence of the dominant *desire machine*.
We are enticed by the ideals of comfort and self-sufficiency, but what happens when everything perpetually exists in a state of *happiness*, devoid of any tension or drama? 
What happens when we no longer need social interaction, or when we have even conquered *death* itself? 
Do we then become Nietzsche's *Last Man* or are we already in such a state?

>"What is love? What is creation? What is longing? What is a star?"
>-- so asks the Last Man, and blinks.
>The earth has become small, and on it hops the Last Man, who makes everything
>small. His species is as ineradicable as the flea; the Last Man lives longest.
>"Formally all the world was insane", -- say the subtlest of them, and they blink.
>"We have discovered happiness" -- say the Last Man, and they blink. -- Nietzsche

While disaster is almost certainly looming within my lifetime, I still want to live my life in such a way that I welcome the demon forcing me to live it over and over again because I once experienced a moment of unimaginable, undescribable, and non-reproducible quality and beauty because I once truly recognized *the other*.
I strive to exist as a contradiction, caught in a constant tension between the *Apollonian* and the *Dionysian*.
In this context, I draw from Hegel, despite my skepticism towards a history progressing towards something more refined.

>Contradiction is at the root of all movement and life and is only in so far as it contains contradiction that anything moves and has impulse and activity. -- Hegel

I doubt that acting in opposition to the prevailing myth will dismantle it because in doing so, we engage in a *dialectic* that perfectly integrates any resistance.
I believe, although without justification, that the solution resides in *creation* and *affirmation*, not in criticism devoid of creation but in the *act of creating to critique*.

Pause for a moment! 
Is this a call for action? 
It appears that every corner of the globe is demanding action, insisting on hustle, productivity, creativity, and more. 
Often, I find myself submerged in a sea of anxiety, born from the unknown -- the uncertainty of what is expected of me (Lacan). 
It feels like we need to be everything, everywhere, all at once in today's world. 
I suspect this is a feeling shared by many young individuals. 
It's like there's a pervasive social expectation to achieve something, to carve out an *identity*, to blaze a trail, to establish a family, but without a clear roadmap to success. 
This pressure can feel heavy, oppressive, an incessant nagging to which we don't know how to react. 
Yet we continue to engage in this relentless competition due to the lack of an alternative vision. 
The fantasy continues to entice us. 
We're encouraged to embrace an entrepreneurial spirit, to take risks, to globetrot, to accumulate debt for that dream home. 
We're prompted to venture out, to "find ourselves" by buying a book, attending a seminar, or enrolling in a course, with the promise that once we discover this elusive "self", we can finally silence that gnawing anxiety.
However, the fantastical, authentic "self" we're taught to envisage doesn't really exist.

So, given that we are constantly implored to act, to produce, to rush, to perform, perhaps we should allow ourselves a pause before diving headlong into productivity again. 
It could be beneficial to take a step back, to contemplate, reflect, and question the dominant narratives that have been presented to us as unassailable truths, as hegemonic and inevitable. 
We might consider adopting a form of *postmodernism* that strips away the certainty from the notion that the prescribed lifestyle is the one we're bound and obliged to embrace.
And we might be able to traverse this desert of meaninglessness by fabricating new narratives, while fully conscious of their artificiality -- transforming from the leon into a child.

>There is no such thing as a script to stick to; no single functional model of relationships; no single dignified or fulfilling lifestyle that is achieved through consumption, affluence or material goods.
>Rather what human beings can do in the world is enriched by the diversity of their performance in the world by art, by poetry, by love, by a sense of collectivity and a sense of building a shared future. 
>Perhaps doing nothing at this moment is the most revolutionary act. -- D. R.

In the face of the inevitability of death, *failing tragically* seems to me much more appealing than being *comfortably numb*. 
I believe it's essential to accept one's own mortality.
It forces us to stop and to reflect on our desires; on what we *care* about.
To reconcile with our finite existence, not to evade reality but rather to engage in it more than ever, and to take up that struggle -- to infuse dignity, kindness, and love into a *dying world*.
