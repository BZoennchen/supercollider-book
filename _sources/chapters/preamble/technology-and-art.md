# Technology and Art

>We might be in a collective state of existential crisis, but we are to busy to notice it.

The current Zeitgeist is technological.
By that I mean that nowadays societies are still critical of the usage of technology but not of so much of technology itself.
The assumption is that humans are still in control of technology, therefore, it is us who decide if technology can be used for something good or bad.
This understanding of technology as something neutral is inherently humanistic, that is, we think of it as something seperated from us; 
something over that we can rule; something that we can control perceisly.
From that subject-object viewpoint, technology is by definition something non-human.
It can be used for the good, the bad, the ugly, and the beautiful and we can decide what to do with it.

However, this viewpoint is increasingly challenged by the advances in *artificial "intelligence"*, especially the branch of *machine learning*.
The line between controlling and being controled gets more and more blurred.

>[...] there is an idea that technology is in its essence something human beings have under their control. In my opinion, that is not possible. Technology is in its essence something that human beings cannot master of their own accord. -- Heidegger

Technology is neither inherently progressive nor repressive.
We must rethink technology as something that, like nature, is not strictly separated from us.
It is an extension of the human body and the human mind in so far that it shapes our *mode of being*.
Technology shapes our way of communication and our material realities;
it opens up spaces of possibilities but, at the same time, closes the door to preexisting ways of life.

For example, the introduction of cars influenced how we plan and build cities and, consequently, possessing a car became mandatory in many areas.
Email changed our communication ethics at the workplace; it made the interaction with emails mandatory.
I see it as a privilege that my generation was one of the last growing up in an internet-free world.
Today, children are confronted with a world of spectacle distractions.
Their desires and their attention is channeled into the profit making fungus.

Massively widespread technology has this dictating ability -- once established, it dictates our way of communication.
It shapes our mundane life, and if we want to live within society, we can not escape it.
We live in an *age of disruption* where technology escapes any deep analysis because it evolves faster than we can blink.
Every-day people are busy.
They are constantly trying to keep up with all the news feeds poking at them, and it becomes hard to apply any narrative to their experiences.
They do not know what is going on.
They are just moving through their day, moment to moment.
It is a disorienting place to be.
Time slips away without any deep satisfaction; another day went to *Instagram*.

The danger is never to stop hustling.
We need spaces that help us not to escape but to **really** engage with technology!
To understand how it affects us, how it changes us, how it can help us and how it might destroy us.
Follwing *Martin Heidegger* there are two distinction we should make: the tools and techniques of modern science, along with all the gadgets created to add material comfort to human life, which he calls *mere technology* and the *essence of technology*, i.e., the structure of the technological world and our way of existing in this world.
Heidegger argues that if all we ever do is gain an increasingly sophisticated understanding of *mere technology*, the mastery of tools and instruments and the application of techniques, even those that indisputable improve our standard of living, without gaining an understanding of the *essence of technology*, our understanding will not free us but only further enslave us.

Now, I am fully aware that Heidegger was a Nazi and when talking about him one should mention that.
Furthermore, one should investigate his philosphy with respcet to his Nazism.

>How is it that such a brilliant mind was taken
in by the Nazis? How could Heidegger be so socially irresponsible? It is the
same problem as with Celan: here is a wonderful writer who was a rotten
anti-Semite [...] I have shown Heidegger’s brain with a mushroom-like tumor
growing out of it to make the point. -- Anselm Kiefer

We have to consider that his worry about *global technology* pushed him towards the Nazi party in the first place.
The Nazis were opposed to the two dominant forms of government of the day that Heidegger associated with *global technology*, communism and democracy.
Therefore, to study Heiddegger is both dangerous and difficult.
It requires great caution and care to appreciate the depth and complexity of his thought, and to be aware of his association with the Nazis.

According to Heidegger, technology is revealing but at the same time it is concealing, an open space between paths, and a place where reality appears in a certain light.
The *essence of technology* (*das Gestell*) is its mode of revealing and concealing.
This means that technological things have their own novel kind of presence, endurance, and connections among parts and wholes.
They have their own way of presenting themselves and the *world* in which they operate -- technology is dominance and control.
However, the heart of the matter is not in any particular machine, process, resource, but rahter that it is *challenging* (herausfordernd): the way the *essence of technology* operates on our understanding of all matters and on the presence of those matters themselves -- the all-pervasive way we confront and are confronted by the technological world.

The mode of revealing that holds sway throughout modern technolgy does not unfold into a bringing forth in the sense of *poiesis* (Gestalt), the revealing that rules in modern technology is a *challenging* (Herausfordern), which puts to nature the unreasonable demand that it supplies energy which can be extracted and stored as such.
It is important to note that for Heidegger the *challenge* preceded the unlocking; the *essence of technology* is thus prior to natural science.
Modern technology is a distraction from our being-in-the-world (Befindlichkeit) which is always dependent on a mood that Heidegger calls Sorge, meaning fear, or worry, or care.

The nature of being-in-the-world is such that we never escape these concerns, but we often try to deny them.
We distract ourselves from our cares, the major one is death, and live inauthentically.
Our relation to technological tools, techniques, and gadgets can provide this distraction, taking us away from our more fundamental experience, luring us into a pseudo-security which is a danger if it prevents the lived awareness of what we ultimately are:

>beings in trouble in a world of uncertainty.

We get used to the internet, smartphones, social media, and other platform economies, and endless repetition of the trivial.
As an individual, we seem powerless concerning new technologies and we might sometimes feel this lack of depth provided by the scattered and disected.
The *essence of technology* robs us of experiencing *nearness* because to experience it, we must encounter things in their truth.
And no matter how much we believe that science will let us encounter the actual in its actuality, science only offers us *representations of things*.
An example from the second lecture illustrates what Heidegger means. 
Scientifically speaking, the distance between a house and the tree in front of it can be measured neutrally: it is thirty feet. 
But in our everyday lives, that distance is not as neutral, not as abstract. Instead, the distance is an aspect of our concern with the tree and the house: the experience of walking, of seeing the tree’s shape grow larger as I come closer, and of the growing separation from the home as I walk away from it.
In the scientific account things become indifferent to our *concerns* (Sorge) by representing both the distance and the object as simple but useful mathematical entities or philosophical ideas, we lose our truest experience of *nearness* and distance.

Furthermore, functioning things lead to more functioning.
And if there is a market (built buy channeling desire, i.e., marketing), we most certainly have to get used to yet another technological fantasy.
Is it *the public* that wants to transfer another big chunk of reality into a *Metaverse*?
No one asked for it but we built it because we can, because we are *challenged* to do so.

I neither advocate for the denial nor for the embracement of technology in general.
I love technology.
Moreover, I probably would be dead without it.
For most of us, rejecting technology is not an option.
We can, however, cultivate a reflexive understanding that enables us to see the way that reality is constructed by our increasingly technological worldview.

>It certainly is not a matter of condemning the industrial and technological fate of humanity. Rather, it is a case of reinventing this fate. -- Bernard Stiegler

Apart from the important distinction of *mere technology* and the *essence of technology* we also have to look at the material reality.
Who controls the production of *mere technology* and to what end?
I think digital technology is powerful and could contribute to solutions of a majority of humanities problems; 
from climate change to income distribution, sensor-based agricultural practice, food, education and the abolishment of racialization, gender discrimination, ableism and classism.
Digital technology can be amazing, but when all decisions about how to deploy and use it are in the hands of business people, then we have a problem.
These people implement a hazardous form of technological-driven society with the economy at its absolute center: a form of *digital / computational capitalism* where algorithms produce money instead of value.

We are no longer in a free market.
We are not in a place where *the people* have the same access to tools and technology.
They are no longer the masters.
When a young person has an idea, they automatically go to a money person because they think that is the only way to get their product developed.
Developers and entrepreneurs often start with a genuine belief to make the world a better place.
They believe their contribution will help the world in some way and be empowering, not just to them and their investors, but to some industry or consumer base.
But then they take money from problematic angles forcing them into specific actions.
Finally, at the stock market, business becomes gamified, i.e., companies are no longer concerned about their product.
Their mind is occupied with winning; 
*Bezos* versus *Sergey Brin* versus *Mark Zuckerberg*.

We have to ask:

>Are we programmers, or are we programmed?

*Meta's* customer is not the little girl using it to make friends.
No, it is the company that is buying the little girl's *social graph*.
Who is *Uber's* customer?
It is not the driver that it should be.
It is not the passenger, which it could be.
It is the shareholder, the investor.
*Uber* does not care about creating a decent, sustainable taxi industry.

We must critically analyze what each technology does, implying that we disregard the *neutral point of view*.
However, I do not advocate for returning to some naturalistic past, i.e., some lost authenticity.
It would bring only disappointment because such authenticity was never there in the first place.
Nature is a beautiful beast; it is *the real* that hunts us; it is us.
*Going back to nature* in the sense that we withdraw from working on landscapes, bodies and psychic systems are unfounded from a naturalistic ontological perspective.
There is no reason why we should not challenge its normative power, especially if constructed power structures are disguised as *natural*!
However, sprinkling in Heidegger, we have to recognize that the domination of nature leads to the domination of man.

The *essence of technology* is challenging and leads to domination.
Aditionally, specific technological tools are also always based on some value and intention, and if we use a particular technology, we have to know what these values and intentions are.
Does this technology empower the right people?
Is it emancipatory and for whom?
How does it change our way of thinking, feeling, and communicating?
Is it helpful for us?
Who is controlling it?
What does it intend to accomplish?
Does it really work as intended?
What spaces does it open up?
Does it offer artistic potential?
What realities does it destroy?
Moreover and maybe most importantly, can we think of it as more than a tool?
Can we appriciate it as a whole -- as it appears to us without reducing it to its parts, function and effects?
I advocate for a culture of conscious engagement -- a society of aware agents within the realm of technology.
A potent society should have the power to reject technological advances in favor of cultural progress.

We have to know how we can be manipulated, what is good for us, and what we need.
For example, we know that non-virtual social interactions are important.
It is calming and reassuring for human organisms to look into someone else's eyes, so to literally move into sync with another person.
Today we have so much communication without synchronization.
The communication is shallow and abstract.
We end up feeling empty and more exhausted.

>The 21st century is oppressed by a crushing sense of finitude and exhaustion. -- *Mark Fisher*

We live between emails, calendars, and *Zoom*-meetings, missing out on the things that really make us happy: talking to other people, playing with our kids, and giving love to others.
At the same time, there is always a *fear of missing out*:
Can I get in on this thing before it is completely gone?
Analysing *mere technology* via a honest scientific lense is important but it does not strike at the core of Heideggers remarks.
Again, to understand *the essence of technology*, we might have to confront ourselves with its and our *being in the world and time*.

What makes me a little optimistic is the younger generation.
Even though we have an increase in suicide rates, probably due to the use of social media, I also observe more caution towards technology (by some).
Young people seem to use technology much more appropriately because they are less fascinated by it.
They seem to understand that these big tech companies are not interested in improving their lives but in using them as vehicles.

I believe technology is always destructive as well as creative.
It disrupts existing spaces and opens up new ones.
Art, on the other hand, can highlight the open relation of *earth* (rock and stone, flood amd famine, birth and death, tools and technology) and the *world* (the cultural and historical horizon that reveals and conceals earth).
It can simultaneously gather them together, so to say.
In contrast to technology artistic works have many paths, they are more open in their *revealing*.
The work of art opens up paths, relations, and possibilities.
Art can open up the meaning of technology so that we might gain an open relationship to it.
For example, a work of art can reveal that we are not sure whether technology can be ignored or wehter it contains a seductive cosmic force that we cannot resist.

We must continually raise the question concerning technology.
I think it is not a question of complete resistance or complete acceptance but of studied ambivalence, calculated withdrawal, and watchful waiting.
Consequently, the artist's responsibility is to reveal and explore this process.
She is the one who creates aesthetic symbols -- a horizon of a possible future.
Neither being prejudiced nor playing the devil's advocate but engaging with technology and its masters honestly.
After all, the artifacts of our past are not given circumstances of nature but are invented by people.
But what happened and what will happen is guided by the horizon of the possible which is *en-framed* (gestellt) by technology and opened up by works of art.
Thinking should presuppose the challenge of technology.
We must disregard our automatic acceptance of the challenge and how things are and "progress" because it leads to a sense of helplessness about changing anything.
There is neither time for the bitter sweet melancholia nor the illusion that small local changes will suffice.
Echoing the words of *Mark Fisher*: I am not worried about a zombie apocalypse, but I am worried that it is easier for people to imagine a zombie apocalypse than to visualize what life will be like in 10 or 20 years from now.
I am concerned that we have already given up, that we lack the imagination and courage to engage via different strategies, and that we will resort to reactions and seemingly easy but unreal solutions.

The digital is a critical factor in driving our pacification and inertia while we are looking into the abyss right in front of us.
So let us engage with it; 
let us be critical; 
let us fight back; 
let us sing a new song of technological empowerment of the people all around the world; 
let us reimagine our *cyberculture*.
Art might help to release us from the grips of technology by opening up a new path, a new awareness of our existence.

>Digital is not here to put an end to anything.
Rather it is here to expand all things, to combine and to make more things attainable.
For the artist, it is the edgiest work of all; the biggest, most exciting challenge in a long history of the synthesis between technology and hand and mind and heart. -- *J.D. Jarvis*

In the end, it might be the *energy of earth* that uncover a possible earth-world relationship.
This might be Heidegger's god, we are waiting and preparing for.

>Philosophy will not be able to bring about a direct change of the present state of the world. This is true not only of philosophy but of all merely human meditations and endeavors. Only a god can still save us. I think the only possibility of salvation left to us is to prepare readiness, through thinking and poetry, for the appearance of the god or for the absence of the god during the decline; so that we do not, simply put, die meaningless deaths, but that when we decline, we decline in the face of the absent god. -- Heidegger, Spiegel inverview in 1966
