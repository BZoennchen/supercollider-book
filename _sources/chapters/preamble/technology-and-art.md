# Technology and Art

>We might be in a collective state of existential crisis, but we are to busy to notice it.

## Introduction

The prevailing zeitgeist today is technological. 
By this, I mean that while contemporary societies may critique the application of technology, they rarely question its essence. 
The assumption is that humans maintain control over technology and can therefore determine whether it is used for beneficial or harmful purposes. 
For instance, the *European Commission* states in their white paper:

>Like any technology, AI brings opportunities and risks.

This perception of technology as a neutral entity is inherently *modern*; 
we view it as something distinct from us, something we can command and control precisely.
In other words, we think of technology as a pure mean to an end.
From a *subject-object* viewpoint, technology is, by definition, non-human. 
It can be harnessed for good or evil, for the ugly or the beautiful, and it's our prerogative to dictate its usage.

>[...] there is an idea that technology is in its essence something human beings have under their control. In my opinion, that is not possible. Technology is in its essence something that human beings cannot master of their own accord. -- Heidegger

This *modern* perspective is challenged by *postmodern* and *posthuman* views on technology. With advancements in artificial intelligence, especially in the field of machine learning, the question about our place within a technological society looms large.

The *mind-body dualism*, leading to the *object-subject distinction*, might be a reasonable theory to base a modern society on, but due to overwhelming evidence, it no longer holds up. 
Body, mind, technology, and other systems are deeply interconnected. 
While only minds/bodies can think, different bodies are coupled via language. 
While machines compute, they are now able to participate in this communication {cite}`esposito:2022`.

Viewed as an instrumental tool, technology is not strictly separate from us but is coupled with our bodies. 
It serves as an extension of our psychic and physical systems, influencing our mode of being. 
Technology shapes our means of communication and our material realities; it expands realms of possibilities, but simultaneously, extinguishes pre-existing lifestyles.

For instance, the advent of cars transformed city planning and construction, subsequently making car ownership a necessity in many regions. 
Email revolutionized workplace communication ethics, making interaction with emails obligatory. 
I consider it a privilege that my generation was among the last to grow up in a world free of the internet. 
Today's children face a barrage of constant distractions. Their desires and attention are funneled into a profit-driven abyss.

Once well-established, technology assumes a commanding role, guiding our modes of communication. 
It influences our everyday life, and if we aim to participate in society, there's no way to avoid it. 
We inhabit an age of disruption, where technology evolves so swiftly that it eludes thorough analysis. 
People are kept busy, constantly striving to keep up with an endless stream of news feeds competing for their attention. 
It becomes challenging to apply any narrative to their experiences. 
They can't fully comprehend what's happening; they merely move through their day, moment by moment. 
It's a disorienting state of existence. 
Time slips away without deep satisfaction; another day sacrificed to Instagram.

The danger lies in the incessant hustle. 
We need spaces that foster our real engagement with technology! 
It's crucial to understand how it influences us, how it transforms us, how it can aid us, and how it might harm us. 
Moreover, in a humane society, people should have the power to decide how and if technological progress should continue.

## Martin Heidegger

Following Martin Heidegger's perspective, this is no longer the case. 
He distinguishes two aspects: the tools and techniques of modern science, along with all the devices created to enhance human comfort, which he refers to as *mere technology*, and the *essence of technology* (*Gestell*), i.e., the structure of the technological world and our *mode of existence* within it. 
To consider technology *essentially* is to see it as an event to which we belong: the structuring, ordering, and requisitioning of everything around us, and of ourselves.
Heidegger argues that if we focus solely on acquiring a more sophisticated understanding of *mere technology* -- mastering tools, instruments, and techniques, even those that indisputably improve our living standards -- without understanding the *essence of technology*, our knowledge will not liberate us but further entrap us.

It is imperative at this point to recognize that Heidegger was a Nazi, an aspect that should be prominently emphasized while discussing his contributions.
In his seminal book, Being and Time {cite}`heidegger:1927`, Heidegger audaciously posited that Western philosophy, dating back to Plato, had neglected or bypassed the fundamental question of what it truly means for something *to be* -- to exist for us before any philosophical or scientific examination. 
Throughout his writings, he attempted to elucidate how Western civilization, following the advent of Greek philosophy, had been steadily moving towards *nihilism*. 
He was of the view that the contemporary cultural and intellectual crisis -- our descent into nihilism -- was inextricably tied to this *oblivion of being*. 
Only a renaissance of being and the sphere in which it is revealed might rescue *modern* humanity.
Some people regard him as the most inventive and influential thinker of his time, while others dismiss him as an obfuscator and an impostor. 

It is essential to analyze his philosophy within the backdrop of his association with Nazism.
Heidegger’s thought always was and remained *illiberal*, tending to encompass all matters, philosophy and politics among them, in a single perspective, ignoring the freedom of most people to act independently.
But if, as Heidegger hoped, his works are to help us understand the challenges technology presents, we must study him both carefully and cautiously -- carefully, to appreciate the depth and complexity of his thought, and cautiously, in light of his association with the Nazis.

>How is it that such a brilliant mind was taken
in by the Nazis? How could Heidegger be so socially irresponsible? It is the
same problem as with Celan: here is a wonderful writer who was a rotten
anti-Semite [...] I have shown Heidegger’s brain with a mushroom-like tumor
growing out of it to make the point. -- Anselm Kiefer

In his later writings on technology {cite}`heidegger:1954`, which mainly concern us in this essay, Heidegger draws attention to technology’s place in bringing about our decline by constricting our experience of things as they are. 
He argues that we now view nature, and increasingly human beings too, only technologically -- that is, we see nature and people only as raw material for technical operations.
We might escape this bondage, Heidegger argues, not by rejecting technology, but by perceiving its danger.

We need to bear in mind that Heidegger's concerns about global technology initially drew him towards the Nazi party. 
The Nazis stood in opposition to the two prevailing forms of governance during that period -- communism and democracy -- which Heidegger associated with global technology. 
Hence, studying Heidegger is both hazardous and intricate. 
It requires great caution and discernment to comprehend the depth and complexity of his thought, all while being acutely aware of his affiliation with the Nazis.

## The Essence of Technology

In *Being and Time* (1927) Heidegger argues *phenomenologically* that theoretical activities such as the natural sciences depend on views of time and space that narrow the understanding implicit in how we deal with the ordinary world of action and concern.
We cannot construct meaningful distance and direction, or understand the opportunities for action, from science’s neutral, mathematical understanding of space and time.
Indeed, this detached and "objective" scientific view of the world restricts our everyday understanding. 
Our ordinary use of things and our *concernful dealings* within the world are pathways to a more fundamental and more truthful understanding of man and being than the sciences provide; 
science flattens the richness of ordinary concern.

Later, Heidegger posits that technology both unveils and conceals, functioning as a clearing between paths where reality manifests in a certain light. 
The *essence of technology* (das *Gestell*) is in its manner of revealing and concealing. 
It is a way in which we encounter entities generally, including nature, ourselves, and, indeed, everything.
This implies that technological entities have their distinct form of presence, persistence, and relationships between parts and wholes. 
They have their unique ways of presenting themselves and the world in which they exist -- technology is about dominance and control. 
However, the heart of the issue lies not in any specific machine, process, or resource. 
Instead, technology is *challenging* (*herausfordernd*): the way the *essence of technology* shapes our understanding of all things, and the existence of those things themselves -- the all-encompassing manner in which we encounter and are encountered by the technological world.

Heidegger observes that because of technology, 

>all distances in time and space are shrinking [and] yet the hasty setting aside of all distances brings no nearness; for nearness does not consist in a small amount of distance. -- Martin Heidegger

We seem to have become nearly incapable of experiencing this nearness, let alone comprehending it, as all things increasingly manifest to us in a technological fashion:we perceive and interact with them as what Heidegger describes as a *standing reserve*, akin to supplies in a storeroom, items of inventory awaiting direction and mobilization, assembly and disassembly, positioning and dismissal. 
Everything presents itself merely as an energy source or as a subject for our orchestration. 
We even perceive human abilities as if they were merely instruments for technological procedures, as when a laborer becomes nothing more than a tool for production.
Leaders, planners, along with the rest of us, are mere human assets to be managed, reorganized, and discarded. 
Every single entity that manifests itself technologically thereby forfeits its unique autonomy and form. We dismiss, conceal, or simply fail to perceive, other potentialities.

The mode of revealing that prevails in modern technology does not manifest as a bringing forth in the sense of *poiesis* (*Gestalt*). 
Instead, the revealing that governs modern technology is a *challenging* (*Herausfordern*) one, which places an unreasonable demand on nature to provide energy that can be extracted and stored. 
It's important to note that, for Heidegger, the *challenge* precedes the unlocking, thus the *essence of technology* predates natural science. 
It was technological thinking that first understood nature in such a way that nature could be challenged to unlock its forces and energy.
Modern technology is a distraction from our state of *being-in-the-world* (*Befindlichkeit*), which is always contingent on a mood that Heidegger calls *Sorge*, i.e., signifying fear, worry, or care.

>Modern technology is not applied natural science, far more is modern natural science the application of the essence of technology. [Nature is therefore] the fundamental piece of inventory of the technological standing reserve — and nothing else. -- Martin Heidegger

The nature of *being-in-the-world* is such that we can never escape these concerns, but we frequently attempt to deny them. 
We distract ourselves from our worries, the primary of which is death, and consequently live inauthentically. 
Our relationship with technological tools, techniques, and devices can aid this distraction, diverting us from our fundamental experience and enticing us into a false sense of security. 
This can be dangerous if it impedes the lived awareness of our ultimate existence::

>beings in trouble in a world of uncertainty.

We become accustomed to the internet, smartphones, social media, platform economies, and the endless repetition of trivialities. As individuals, we can often feel powerless in the face of new technologies, and occasionally experience a lack of depth provided by the scattered and dissected elements of our existence. 
The *essence of technology* deprives us of experiencing nearness because to truly experience it, we must encounter things in their truth. 
No matter how deeply we believe that science will allow us to engage with reality in its actuality, science only provides us with representations of things.
It only ever encounters that which its manner of representation has previously admitted as a possible object for itself.

An example from the second lecture illustrates what Heidegger means. 
From a scientific perspective, the distance between a house and the tree in front of it can be measured objectively: it is thirty feet. 
However, in our everyday lives, that distance is not neutral or abstract.
Instead, it is an aspect of our concern with the tree and the house, reflected in the experience of walking, seeing the tree’s shape grow larger as we approach it, and feeling an increasing separation from the house as we walk away from it. 
In the scientific account, things become indifferent to our concerns (Sorge); by representing both the distance and the objects as simple mathematical entities or philosophical concepts, we lose our authentic experience of nearness and distance.

The *challenging* essence of technology implies that functioning things lead to more functioning things.
Everything is *challenged* to serve as a systematic resource for technological application, which we subsequently utilize as a resource for further application, perpetuating a cycle. 
For instance, we *challenge* land to produce coal, considering the land as nothing more than a coal deposit. 
The coal is then stockpiled, always ready to unleash the stored solar heat it contains, which is then called upon for warmth, which subsequently is commanded to yield steam whose pressure drives the wheels that sustain a factory's operations. 
The factories themselves are *challenged* to create tools through which machines are once again put into service and preserved. 
If a market exists (constructed by directing desire, i.e., marketing), we will likely have to adapt to yet another technological illusion.
This chain does not move toward anything that has its own presence, but, instead, "only enters into its *circuit*", and is "regulating and securing" natural resources and energies in this never-ending fashion.
Under this perspective we can ask: Is it the public that wants to transfer another significant part of reality into a Metaverse? 
No one asked for it, but we built it because we can, because we are challenged to do so.

>A success is that type of consequence that itself remains assigned to the yielding of further consequences. -- Martin Heidegger

Alternative ways of comprehending distance and time, beyond the increasingly precise and impartial measuring with rulers and clocks, start to elude us; 
they no longer appear to be modes of understanding but at best, indistinct poetic portrayals. 
While many critics of technology highlight its apparent dangers, Heidegger underscores a different type of peril: the potential of technology to obstruct us from hearing "the call of a more primal truth".
The issue is not solely that technology impedes our access to this sphere, but that it causes us to entirely forget the existence of this realm.
Nevertheless, Heidegger posits that by acknowledging this danger allows, we're able to discern and then address what has been neglected. 
The realization of our essence as receptive to this sphere, and of technology as merely one avenue through which things can manifest, is the roadmap for keeping technology within its appropriate confines. 
The thought that unfolds the potential for a *turn* away from technology and towards its fundamental domain is the recognition of its hazard.

>But where the danger is, there grows also what saves. -- Friedrich Hölderlin

## The Need to Differentiate

Heidegger’s arguments about technology also raise several difficulties. 
Indeed, one might inquire (despite Heidegger's objection to such questioning) about the origins of technology in its essence. 
Is the manner in which beings reveal themselves to us meaningful only in Heidegger's terms, or can a rationale be provided for this meaning that simultaneously permits and even requires moral decision-making and openness to being beyond Heidegger's limits? 
Given that phenomena appear to us technologically in a manner seemingly tied to choices we make based on specific conceptions of happiness, the good, and the sacred (all of which are, to some degree, subject to rational debate), isn't it valid that all things technological can be judged, questioned, assessed, and ranked? 
Is our comprehension of happiness, the good, and the sacred truly subservient to a preliminary understanding of entities as technological, or is it intertwined and contemporaneous with it, or even preceding it?

I am not advocating for either denial or embracement of technology in general. 
I love technology, and indeed, I would probably be dead without it. 
For most of us, rejecting technology is no longer an option. 
However, I believe that we can cultivate a reflexive understanding that enables us to recognize how reality is constructed by our increasingly technological worldview.

>It certainly is not a matter of condemning the industrial and technological fate of humanity. Rather, it is a case of reinventing this fate. -- Bernard Stiegler

In addition to the crucial distinction between *mere technology* and the *essence of technology*, we must also examine material reality. 
Who controls the production of mere technology and to what end? 
I believe that digital technology is potent and could help solve many of humanity's problems, from climate change to income distribution, sensor-based agricultural practices, food, education, and the eradication of racialization, gender discrimination, ableism, and classism.
Digital technology can be incredible, but when decisions about its deployment and use are exclusively in the hands of businesspeople, we encounter a problem.
These individuals implement a perilous form of a technology-driven society with the economy at its absolute center: a type of digital/computational capitalism where algorithms generate money rather than value.

Additionally, it may be worth considering Heidegger's perspective on technology, which I am unable to elaborate fully upon here.
We are likely to encounter significant issues if we believe that technology alone will resolve all of today's major challenges, while it undeniably contributes to many of them.
Moreover, the symbols of the struggle for a more equitable society have already been integrated into the very system that requires transformation. 
The heated ecosystem of culture wars serves as a divisive instrument that erodes the public capacity to demand enduring material changes.

We are no longer operating in a free market. 
Late-stage capitalism now features a new type of platform economy that resembles feudalism, where peasants work the land of the lords. 
We're in a situation where people don't have equal access to tools and technology and no longer maintain control. 
When a young person has an idea, they naturally approach a financier, perceiving it as the only way to get their product developed. 
Developers and entrepreneurs often start with a genuine desire to improve the world. 
They believe their contribution will benefit the world and empower not just them and their investors, but also some industry or consumer base. 
However, accepting funding from problematic sources often forces them into specific actions. 
Ultimately, on the stock market, business becomes gamified. 
Companies shift their focus away from their products and become preoccupied with competition -- Bezos versus Sergey Brin versus Mark Zuckerberg.

Additionally, since the digital industry is characterized by non-scarcity, it had to introduce a new business logic that gathers, concentrates, and "protects" knowledge and information. 
Under the guise of improving customer services, this new business logic aims to provide consumers with exactly what they want. 
I would argue, however, that the goal is more about manipulating consumers into an endless cycle of mostly subpar consumer goods. 
As previously discussed in [Extreme Consumerism](sec-consumerism), desire is produced, channeled, and confused.

We have to ask:

>Are we programmers, or are we programmed?

The customer of *Meta* is not the young girl using it to forge friendships. 
Rather, it's the company purchasing the girl's *social graph*. 
Who is *Uber*'s customer? It isn't the driver, though it should be. 
Nor is it the passenger, even though it could be. 
Instead, it's the shareholder, the investor. 
*Uber* isn't concerned about creating a robust, sustainable taxi industry.

We must critically analyze the implications of each technology, which means we must abandon the neutral point of view.
However, I'm not advocating for a return to some mythical naturalistic past, some elusive authenticity. 
This would only lead to disillusionment because such authenticity was never present to begin with. 
Nature is a splendid beast; it is *the real* that pursues us.
The notion of returning to nature -- withdrawing from altering landscapes, bodies, and psychological systems -- lacks basis from a naturalistic ontological perspective. 
There's no reason why we shouldn't challenge its normative power, particularly when constructed power structures masquerade as natural! 
But, heeding Heidegger, we must acknowledge that 

>dominating nature leads to the domination of humanity.

The *essence of technology* is inherently challenging and tends to lead to domination. 
Moreover, specific technological tools are invariably based on certain values and intentions. 
If we opt to utilize a particular technology, we must understand these underlying values and intentions.

Does this technology empower the right people? 
Who is it emancipatory for? How does it alter our ways of thinking, feeling, and communicating? 
Is it beneficial to us? Who is in control of it? What are its intended goals? 
Does it truly function as anticipated? What new possibilities does it create? 
Does it harbor artistic potential? What existing realities does it dismantle?
Moreover, and perhaps most crucially, can we perceive it as more than just a tool? 
Can we appreciate it in its entirety -- as it presents itself to us, without reducing it to its constituent parts, functions, and effects? I am a proponent of a culture of mindful engagement -- a society of informed participants within the sphere of technology. 
A capable society should possess the authority to reject technological progress in favor of cultural advancement.

We must understand how we can be manipulated, what is beneficial for us, and what our needs are. 
For instance, we know that non-virtual social interactions are vital. 
It's soothing and comforting for human beings to make eye contact with others, thereby achieving physical synchronization with another person. 
Today, much of our communication lacks this synchronization. 
This communication is superficial and abstract, leaving us feeling hollow and increasingly fatigued.
However, approaching this issue from a scientific perspective, that is, socializing because we understand it's beneficial for us, misinterprets the essence of the matter as we would be treating togetherness as a *mere tool*, i.e., technology!

>The 21st century is oppressed by a crushing sense of finitude and exhaustion. -- *Mark Fisher*

We exist within a constant churn of emails, calendars, and Zoom meetings, often neglecting the things that truly bring us happiness: engaging in conversations with others, playing with our children, and expressing love. 
Concurrently, there persists an ever-present *fear of missing out*: can I seize this opportunity before it's entirely gone? 
Analyzing *mere technology* through an honest scientific lens is valuable, yet it doesn't address the crux of Heidegger's observations. 
To comprehend the *essence of technology*, we might need to grapple with its and our being-in-the-world and time.

What engenders a degree of optimism in me is the younger generation.
Despite the rising suicide rates, arguably linked to social media usage, I've noticed a trend of increased caution towards technology among some individuals. 
Many young individuals in my vicinity seem to utilize technology more judiciously, primarily because they are less captivated by it.
They appear to comprehend that these massive tech companies are not invested in enhancing their lives, but rather in leveraging them as tools.

I am of the belief that technology is invariably both destructive and creative. 
It disrupts existing spaces while simultaneously forging new ones. 
Art, however, has the capacity to accentuate the open relationship between *earth* (rock and stone, flood and famine, birth and death, tools and technology) and the *world* (the cultural and historical horizon that both reveals and conceals the earth). 
Art can, so to speak, unify them.
Unlike technology, artistic works offer numerous paths and are more open in their *revealing*. 
An artwork opens up pathways, relationships, and possibilities. 
Art can elucidate the meaning of technology, enabling us to develop an open relationship with it. 
For instance, a piece of art can expose our uncertainty about whether technology can be disregarded, or whether it embodies a seductive cosmic force that we're incapable of resisting.

## Turning Away from Danger

We are obliged to perpetually reflect on the *essence of technology* and its *danger*. 
I believe it's not a matter of outright resistance or unconditional acceptance, but rather of informed ambivalence, deliberate retreat, and vigilant anticipation. 
According to Heidegger, things can show or *reveal* themselves to us in different ways, and it is attention to this that will help us recognize that technology is itself one of these ways, but only one.
Other kinds of *revealing*, and attention to the realm of *truth* and *being* as such, will allow us to experience the technological within its own bounds.
Consequently, the artist's duty is to disclose and explore this process *phenomenologically*. 
She is the one who crafts aesthetic symbols, setting the stage for a possible future. 
The approach should involve neither prejudice nor antagonism, but rather sincere engagement with technology and its creators. 
After all, the artifacts of our past aren't natural occurrences but are crafted by people. 
Yet, what has transpired and what will occur are guided by the horizon of possibility, which is *enframed* (gestellt) by technology and unveiled by artistic works.

Our thought process should acknowledge the *challenge* posed by technology.
We must enter the realm where things can show themselves to us truthfully in a manner not limited to the technological.
We must resist our automatic acceptance of the *challenge* and the current state of "progress", as it tends to instill a sense of powerlessness towards instigating change. 
There is neither room for bittersweet melancholy nor illusions that minor local changes will be adequate.

Echoing the words of Mark Fisher: I'm not apprehensive about a zombie apocalypse; rather, my concern lies in the ease with which people can envisage such an apocalypse, in contrast to visualizing life a decade or two hence. 
My worry is that we may have already conceded defeat, that we lack the imagination and bravery to adopt different strategies, and that we might succumb to reflexive responses and seemingly easy but unrealistic solutions.

Digital technology plays a critical role in inducing our complacency and inertia, even as we stare into the impending abyss. 
Therefore, let's engage with it proactively. Let's cultivate a critical perspective. 
Let's counteract its overbearing influence. Let's compose a new anthem of technological empowerment for people across the globe. 
Let's reimagine our *cyberculture*. 
Art could potentially help liberate us from technology's grasp by charting a new path, a new consciousness of our existence.

Ultimately, it may be the *energy of earth* that unveils a potential earth-world relationship. 
This could be Heidegger's god, for whom we are waiting and preparing for.

>Philosophy will not be able to bring about a direct change of the present state of the world. This is true not only of philosophy but of all merely human meditations and endeavors. Only a god can still save us. I think the only possibility of salvation left to us is to prepare readiness, through thinking and poetry, for the appearance of the god or for the absence of the god during the decline; so that we do not, simply put, die meaningless deaths, but that when we decline, we decline in the face of the absent god. -- Heidegger, Spiegel inverview in 1966
