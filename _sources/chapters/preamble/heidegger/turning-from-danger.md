# Turning Away from Danger

We are obliged to perpetually reflect on the *essence of technology* and its *danger*. 
I believe it's not a matter of outright resistance or unconditional acceptance, but rather of informed ambivalence, deliberate retreat, and vigilant anticipation.
As Luhmann rightfully emphasised: Our society is **contingent**, that is, everything that is could be different.
Modern society is more and more unpredictable on a global, but also on a personal level.
We can not predict our state over ten years.
Our perspective into the future is very different from ancient times.
I must believe that there is the possibility that our *mode of seeing* the world can change into something radical different.

It is attention to technology as a *mode of seeing* that might help us.
Other kinds of *revealing*, and attention to the realm of *truth* and *being* as such, will allow us to experience the technological within its own bounds.
Consequently, the artist's duty is to disclose and explore this process *phenomenologically*. 
She is the one who crafts aesthetic symbols, setting the stage for a possible future. 
The approach should involve neither prejudice nor antagonism, but rather *sincere engagement* with technology and its creators. 
After all, the artifacts of our past aren't natural occurrences but are crafted by people. 
Yet, what has transpired and what will occur are guided by the horizon of possibilities, which is *enframed* (gestellt) by technology and unveiled by artistic works.

Our thought process should acknowledge the *challenge* posed by technology.
We must enter the realm where things can show themselves to us truthfully in a manner not limited to the technological.
We must resist our automatic acceptance of the *challenge* and the current state of "progress", as it tends to instill a sense of powerlessness towards instigating change. 
There is neither room for bittersweet melancholy nor illusions that minor local changes will be adequate.

Echoing the words of Mark Fisher: I'm not apprehensive about a zombie apocalypse; rather, my concern lies in the ease with which people can envisage such an apocalypse, in contrast to visualizing life a decade or two hence. 
My worry is that we may have already conceded defeat, that we lack the imagination and bravery to adopt different strategies, and that we might succumb to reflexive responses and seemingly easy but unrealistic solutions.

>Philosophy will not be able to bring about a direct change of the present state of the world. This is true not only of philosophy but of all merely human meditations and endeavors. Only a god can still save us. I think the only possibility of salvation left to us is to prepare readiness, through thinking and poetry, for the appearance of the god or for the absence of the god during the decline; so that we do not, simply put, die meaningless deaths, but that when we decline, we decline in the face of the absent god. [... The place once occupied by philosophy is now] cybernetics.  -- Heidegger, Spiegel inverview in 1966

While many critics of technology highlight its apparent dangers, Heidegger underscores a different type of peril: the potential of technology to obstruct us from hearing "the call of a more primal truth".
The issue is not solely that technology impedes our access to this sphere, but that it causes us to entirely forget the existence of this realm.
Nevertheless, Heidegger posits that by acknowledging this danger, we might be able to discern and then address what has been neglected. 
The realization of our essence as receptive to this sphere, and of technology as merely one avenue through which things can manifest, is the roadmap for keeping technology within its appropriate confines. 
The thought that unfolds the potential for a *turn* away from technology and towards its fundamental domain is the recognition of its hazard.

Ultimately, it may be the *energy of earth* that unveils a potential earth-world relationship. 
This could be Heidegger's god, for whom we are waiting and preparing for.

>[...] where the danger is, there grows also what saves. -- Friedrich HÃ¶lderlin

But will it be too late? 
Will *earth* totally conceal the *world*?
The future is looking grim but imagining the catastrophe is out of my horizon but it horrifies me.
