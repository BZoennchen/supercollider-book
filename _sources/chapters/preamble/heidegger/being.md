# Being in the World

>The self is a relation that relates itself to itself. -- Soren Kierkegaard

Heidegger's emphasis on *ordinary life* may seem trivial, yet, how frequently do we feel lost, overwhelmed, and alienated in the world, even though we are experts in navigating this chaos? 
Often, we forget that we are temporal beings in a world where we are deeply rooted.
This fact becomes crystal clear when considering all the small habits our bodies carry out so effortlessly that we hardly give them a thought.
All the smells we can perceive, all the various tactile experiences we can receive and give, all the sounds we can differentiate, and the ways in which we can walk, sit, run, and dance. 
Sometimes, when one feels lost in the digital spectacle, returning to the simplicity of the ordinary can offer a reassuring sense of home---and we are deeply home here and now.

Few would dispute that technology has transformed our self-perception. 
From a scientific perspective, we are more and more humiliated by what we see through science:

+ **Copernicus**: Earth is not the center of the universe.
+ **Nietzsche**: God is dead, implying that normative values are constructed and lack any metaphysical essence.
+ **Darwin**: Humans are not the apex of creation but part of an evolutionary biological process.
+ **Freud**: The human "ego" is not fully in control but is governed by unconscious processes.
+ **AI**: Machines can execute task that we thought require human thinking.

A scientific definition of beings will make us blind for their mysterious and unexplainable presence in the world.
In Heidegger's term: it will make us blind for *Being*.
The danger is to lose the ability of seeing the world and its beings as they appears to us and to understand ourselves not as mere thinking subjects but as *Dasein* that is in the world in a mode of uncovering, i.e. disclosing other entities as well as ourselves.
For Heidegger, *Dasein* is the "there"---or the locus---of Being and thus the metaphorical place where entities "show themselves" as what they are.
It is the being that has an understanding of *Being*.
In other words, *Dasein* is simply Heidegger’s term for human beings.

He intentionally used the term because he felt as though the words most often used by philosophers to designate human beings, words like “consciousness”, "self-consciousness", "subject", "soul", etc., carried far too much metaphysical baggage, and, thus, found it necessary to come up with a new term for human beings. 
Decartes view of *the self* as self-subsistent and worldless *subject* changes in Heidegger's phenomenologically perspective because *Dasein* is always *Being-(involved)-in-the-world*.
To be a self is to have a world.
Like Husserls world, Heidegger's world is a practical world of interconnected beings where equipment presupposes other equipment and is truly what it is only when it is being used transparently.
We can reformulate Descartes' "Cogito ergo sum" from a Heideggerian perspective: I am, therefore the world is.

>We shall call those entities which we encounter in concern "equipment". In our dealings we come across equipment for writing, sewing, working, transportation, measurement. [...] Taken strictly, there 'is' no such thing as an equipment. To the Being of any equipment there always belongs a totality of equipment, in which it can be this equipment that it is. Equipment is essentially 'something in-order-to [...]'. A totality of equipment is constituted by various ways of the 'in-order-to'. [...] In the 'in-order-to' as a structure there lies an assignment or reference of something to something. [...] Equipment---in accordance with its equipmentality---always is in terms of its belonging to other equipment: ink-stand, pen, paper, blotting pad, table, lamp, furniture, windows, doors, room. [...] What we encounter as closest to us (though not as something taken as a theme) is the room; and we encounter it not as something 'between four walls' in a geometrical spatial sense, but as equipment for residing. Out of this the 'arrangement' emerges, and it is in this that any 'individual' item of equipment shows itself. Before it does so, a totality of equipment has already been discovered. Equipment can genuinely show itself only in dealings cut to its own measure (hammering with a hammer, for example); but in such dealings an entity of this kind is not grasped thematically as an occurring Thing, nor is the equipment-structure known as such in the using. The hammering does not simply have knowledge about the hammer’s character as equipment, but it has appropriated this equipment in a way which could not possibly be more suitable. In dealings such as this, where something is put to use, our concern subordinates itself to the "in-order-to" which is constitutive for the equipment we are employing at the time; the less we just stare at the hammer-Thing, and the more we seize hold of it and use it, the more primordial does our relationship to it become, and the more unveiledly is it encountered as that which it is---as equipment. [...] The peculiarity of what is proximally ready-to-hand is that, in its readiness-to-hand, it must, as it were, withdraw in order to be ready-to-hand quite authentically. -- Martin Heidegger

Heidegger’s concerns of technology also raise several difficulties.
It tends to romanticize certain types of tools.
His texts are filled with what we may call a romanticization of German country life that is hard not to relate to Heidegger’s involvement with Nazism.
And isn't the distinction between good (ancient Greeks) and bad technologies (modern times) just a subjective preference.
Why exactly does the hydroelectrical dam on the Rhine provoke nature whereas the temple doesn't? 
Is the manner in which beings reveal themselves to us meaningful only in Heidegger's terms, or can a rationale be provided for this meaning that simultaneously permits and even requires openness to *Being* beyond Heidegger's limits?
In other words, can a scientific view enrich the mystery of the world?
Richard Feynman, at least, seems to think so.

>I have a friend, who is an artist. And he is sometimes taken a view which I don't agree with very well. He hold up a flower and says: "Look how beautiful it is." And I agree. And he says: "I as an artist can see how beautiful that is but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a doll thing." And I think he is kind of nutty. First of all the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me too. I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is but I can appreciate the beauty of the flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I can image cells in it; the complicated actions inside which also have a beauty. I mean it is not just beauty at this dimension of one centimeter, there is also beauty at a smaller dimensions; the inner structure also the processes; the fact that the colors and the flowers evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting. It means that insects can see the color. It adds a question: does this aesthetic sense also exist in lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? All kinds of interesting questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement and mystery in the aura of a flower; it only adds. I don't understand how it subtracts. -- Richard Feynman

It would be foolish to advocate for a return to some mythical naturalistic past or some elusive authenticity. 
This would only lead to disillusionment because such authenticity was never present to begin with.
Nature is a splendid beast; it is *the real* that pursues us.
It is not our tools, methods and techniques that are at the center of Heidegger's concerns but our way of seeing the world.
He sees danger in the domination of nature which, for him, ultimately leads to the domination of humanity.
But is it a question of black and white?
Is there room for both *instrumental* and *non-instrumental* thinking and seeing?
Can we see the mystical whole---the world as it appears to us---and its no less magical parts, structure, and abstraction?
I believe there is.

>For all of us, the arrangements, devices, and machinery of technology are to a greater or lesser extent indispensable. It would be foolish to attack technology blindly. It would be shortsighted to condemn it as the work of the devil. We depend on technical devices. -- Martin Heidegger

Let's consider an analogy: the concept of *free* and *instrumental play*, as introduced by Wolfgang Iser in {cite}`iser:1993`. 
Iser labels play in games with specific goals as *instrumental play*.
At the other end of the spectrum is *free play*, a form of play devoid of definite endpoints, perpetuating the continuity of play.
*Instrumental play* is a goal-oriented approach that values efficiency, expertise, and optimized strategies as components of play. 
For instance, if children engage with their surroundings, such as running around, this can be considered *free play*.
However, when they introduce goals like catching one another, the play tends more towards *instrumental play*.
The aim of playing isn't solely to reach the end but to discover the most effective way of getting there.
However, there's no such thing as pure *free* or pure *instrumental* play.
Playing chess to win money leans heavily towards *instrumental* play, while playing with a ball purely to enjoy the physical experience is predominantly *free* play. Furthermore, there's no inherently "good" or "bad" style of play. 
In fact, the issue sometimes arises when we deem *instrumental play* to be the correct, or "good," way to play.
But here's the crucial point: *instrumental play* isn't the opposite of *free play*; 
instead, there exists a tension between the two. 
One can derive deep enjoyment from improving a skill, achieving goals, or uncovering solutions to complex problems. 
Similarly, we can perceive the earth and its inhabitants instrumentally (as a means to an end) or appreciate them for what they are (as ends in themselves).

Therefore, I favor the Kantian notion extended to all beings as well as things---never viewing anything merely as a mean to an end, but always as an end in itself. 
Furthermore, just as *instrumental play* can enrich *free play*, such as by enabling other forms of *free play* via the acquisition of new skills and habits, I also believe that the scientific perspective, which necessitates objectifying entities and often neglects the broader context, can still enhance our appreciation of the whole.
Nonetheless, it remains challenging to dismiss Heidegger's concerns.

I think we can become aware of our instrumental thinking, of our own *will to power*.
We are at a point in time where the *standing reserve* seems to break under the pressure of dominance.
We are likely to encounter significant issues if we believe that technology alone, i.e., further *instrumental thinking* will resolve all of today's major *challenges*, while it undeniably contributes to many of them.
Thinking in cause and effect to the end of day will not provide us with the wisdom to overcome the breaking down of the standing reverse.

>It certainly is not a matter of condemning the industrial and technological fate of humanity. Rather, it is a case of reinventing this fate. -- Bernard Stiegler
