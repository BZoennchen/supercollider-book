# Heidegger and the Nazis

In the following I want to talk about my interpretation of Martin Heidegger's understanding of technology.
Heidegger was deeply influenced by his teacher Edmund Husserl who established the school of *phenomenology*.
Heidegger was convinced that the best way to understand an entity is to understand it in its *Being*, which can only be discovered by looking at it, not through theorization or analysis of concepts:

>Before words, before expressions, always the phenomena first, and then the concepts! -- Martin Heidegger

His view is very practical but also a difficult way of seeing and understanding ontology.
It is difficult because we are not used to it.
Heidegger's analysis amounts to an investigation of prereflective action, of the activities we engage in without first conceptualizing them.
The truth is that we do not have to conceptualize the world around us---its rules and boundaries, conventions and assumptions---unless, of course, this world breaks down.
Philosophy, for far too long, had tried to fit all beings into one category scheme, making metaphysics more primary than phenomena themselves.
Heidegger insisted that we must

>let what shows itself be seen from itself, just as it shows itself from itself. -- Martin Heidegger

But before we can talk about that I have to include an important disclaimer!

While discussing the philosophical contributions of Heidegger, it is essential to acknowledge his association with *National Socialism*.
He actively endorsed this ideology and exploited it as a mechanism for acquiring control, influence, and power.
For instance, he employed the services of the Gestapo (the Geheime Staatspolizei) to sideline his colleagues.
In other instances, he helped students to move away from the danger.
He saw "great potential" in the *Führer* and, at least at some point in time, believed that Nazism enables the *dwelling* he desires.
Regrettably, Heidegger neither apologized nor distanced himself from his actions, nor did he acknowledge any wrongdoing.
Instead, he attempted to obfuscate and justify his actions, which is particularly disconcerting given the fact that both his mentor, Edmund Husserl, and his student (and romantic partner), Hannah Arendt, were of Jewish descent.

Moreover, many argue that it is impossible to separate Heidegger's politics from his philosophy---they are intertwined, and I tend to agree, at least to some extent.
Thus, engaging with Heidegger's work can be a perilous undertaking, even if many of his ideas are incompatible with Nazism.
Maybe it was his concern with technology that spiraled into fear and desperation, leading him to view Nazism as a means to escape the prevailing technological mode of being in his time.

>Heidegger is, so to speak, the Hegelian of our time, who was also a Nazi, among other things. The worst part is that in Germany and all over the world, for example in South America, France, and Spain, Heidegger is admired and imitated. [...] He usually writes things that one cannot understand at all, and that too, for pages on end! -- Karl Popper

Notable critics include Karl Jaspers, Theodor W. Adorno (Frankfurt School), Jürgen Habermas (Frankfurt School), Kurt Tucholsky, and numerous others.
Heidegger's thinking and writing have been criticized for dressing up banalities as profound insights, projecting his personal moods onto others, hiding behind an overly complex language, overemphasizing the role of human beings in determining the nature of being, lacking any ethical content, circular reasoning and tautologies, being the root for the rise of *relativism* and the rejection of objective turths.

Despite these criticisms, Heidegger remains an influential figure in the history of philosophy, and his ideas continue to be debated and studied in academic circles.
He influenced the works of Herbert Marcuse, Jean-Paul Sartre, Jacques Derrida, Paul Tillich, Michel Foucault and many more.
It would be a mistake to completely dismiss his works because of his character.
But it would also be a mistake to dive into his work without knowing about his actions and connections to the Nazi party.

>How is it that such a brilliant mind was taken in by the Nazis? How could Heidegger be so socially irresponsible? It is the same problem as with Celan: here is a wonderful writer who was a rotten anti-Semite [...] I have shown Heidegger's brain with a mushroom-like tumor growing out of it to make the point. -- Anselm Kiefer
