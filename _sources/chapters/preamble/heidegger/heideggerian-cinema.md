# Heideggerian Cinema

Let me look into the works of Andrei Tarkovsky, Terrence Malick and Michael Haneke with an Heideggerian perspective.
While Tarkovsky and Malick are existential filmmakers, Haneke is more of a critique of his own profession.
However, all three try to ask questions rather than providing answers.

Tarkovsky thought of art as revealing the *transcedental*.
He thought art is the only way to it.

>It appears as a revelation, as a momentary, passionate wish to grasp intuitively and at a stroke all the laws of this world---its beauty and ugliness, its compassion and cruelty, its infinity and its limitations. -- Andrei Tarkovsky

For Tarkovsky, embracing art comes close to a spiritual experience and its creation to an act of faith.
By his films he was exploring our world in search for understanding---he was observing *Dasein's* questioning of its own *Being* by praying through cinema.
As his characters say:

>We need a mirror.

For Tarkovsky this mirror would not depict our experiences as a linear sequence of events, captured objectively and logically into what could be called a plot.
Instead, we would see a complex web of thoughts, memories and emotions and all these would be deeply interconnected to other beings, be it other *Daseins*, tools, or things *present-at-hand*.
We would see a being that experiences a practical world subjectively, gives shape to it and is shaped by it subjectively.
A being that is shaped by its past, moves through the present by projecting itself into its own future and observing each new moment with a consciousness made up of impressions, distortions, and associations.
Tarkovsky, like Heidegger, was wrestling with time as an essential feature of the human condition.
*Dasein* projects itself into the future.
It imagines to be a certain way.

>Time is said to be irreversible. And this is true enough in the sense that 'you can't bring back the past', as they say.
>But what exactly is this 'past'?
>Is it what has passed?
>And what does 'passed' mean for a person when for each of us the past is the bearer of all that is constant in the reality of the present, of each current moment?
>In a certain sense the past is far more real, or at any rate more stable, more resilient than the present.
>The present slips and vanishes like sand between the fingers, acquiring material weight only in its recollection. -- Andrei Tarkovsky

To capture *truth as unconcealment* artists best trust their own heart, follow their own instinct; and hope that if something resonated with them on a personal level, if something left an impression, however intangible, unexplainable, it will do the same for others.
For Tarkovsky as well as Heidegger art is neither there to be analysed or ripped apart, nor is it there for pure aesthetically reasons.
For both it is about a certain kind of truth.
While Heidegger thinks of the unconcealment and opening of a world, Tarkovsky thinks of the opening of a *spiritual* world.
Both, I think, see in great art a guiding aspect to find oneself, or in Heidegger's terms, to be *authentic towards death* by which he does not refer to today's meaning of "being authentic".
Instead, he uses the Greek meaning of the word: to take a stand and make a final, irreversible choice by choosing one thing while *killing* all the other possibilities---a view also shared by Kierkegaard.
It is *existential time* and our finitude that gifts us *authenticity*. 

And here we are back at the *essence of technology* which makes everything measurable and exchangable by putting an exchange value on all things.
In the consumer and technological age of the twenty-first century we are surrounded by exchange values everywhere.
Ever more areas of our lives are being technologized and marketed, thereby adding infinite anonymity at the expense of authenticity.
Making a definite, irreversible choice becomes a challenge when the possibilities expand without limit.
Therefore, one eventually tends to wait anxiously before making any definite choices as if life itself were unlimited.
But the price to pay is a meaning and identity crisis.
And if someone struggles to find their identity within themselves then there are all sorts of groups and movements to provide it for them.
Eventually even the devil becomes more appealing as a leader, simply because it has a strong personality.

I think, seeing the world opened by the works of art, is conditions on our belief that such a thing exists in the first place which can be difficult in a world that seems to actively discourage us from looking past the immediate material reality.
Tarkovsky (e.g. in *Stalker*) as well as Kierkegaard, warns us of a society that seeks to conquer the infinite with the finite.
If we lose our ability to hope and believe in something greater than ourselves and disregard all that which is experienced irrationally and poetically, we may forever fall into the inauthentic mass (Heidegger) or, in Kierkegaard's terms, lose ourselves.
A world stripped of its spirituality will be a cruel one, in the sense that it will no longer prepare us for death.

Another film director which is even more relatable to Heidegger's philosophy is Terrence Malick.
Malick once attempted a doctorate on Heidegger, Kierkegaard, and Wittgenstein at Harvard.
His films often hew closely to and examine---in both narrative and form---ideas about the essence of humanity and phenomenology advanced by Heidegger.
This can be seen in his existential style but also his use of ever questioning voice-overs which I see as *Dasein's* questioning of *Being*.
The whispering turns the film into poetry in motion.

Malick, like no other, depicts a practical world of phenomena instead of a world of facts and a linearly progressing story.
He let's us experience the mystical of *the ordinary* which is, in fact, *extraordinary*.
The camera is constantly moving.
It follows the characters at different angles but also lingers and wanders away.
Thereby, the camera focuses on the world that surrounds our characters.
The camera seems to be more interested in exploring the beauty and mystery of the world of the characters than the characters themselves---much like Malick is not really interested in his own story.
The camera looks at beings as they are thus revealing the multiplicity of *Being*.

>All of [Malick's] movies are about worlds. [...] Each film is about some aspect of the world. -- Hubert Dreyfus

And according to Martin Woessner in *What Is Heideggerian Cinema? Film, Philosophy, and Cultural Mobility* {cite}`woessner:2011`:
Film gives us a meaningful world at the same time that it mirrors our own growing alienation from the world.
Moviegoers are simultaneously engaged and disengaged.
With regard to the former, we can say that cinema gives us what, in our everyday lives, we take for granted or do not acknowledge, mainly because it is too difficult to do so.
It gives us precisely what Malick was looking for as a student in his philosophy classes, namely, a sense of the world, if not exactly a complete knowledge of one's place in it.

Instead of insisting, Malick is insightful. 
Instead of filling spaces, he opens them up.
By being playful, wasteful as well as ambiguous his craft goes against the utilitarian method.
Especially in his later works, there is barely any structure or dialog.
He hasn't bounded his work within the 'technical' language of film like a poet who does not bound his work to the normal use of language. 

If one wants to get a better understanding of Heidegger's kind of thinking, experiencing the childhood portrayed in *The Tree of Life* is a good place to start.
It is a meditation on *Being*.
It ask the question with which Heidegger started:

>Why is there something rather than nothing?

While being a very personal movie, Malick wishes that 

>the 'I' who speaks in this story is not the author. Rather, he hopes that you see yourself in this 'I' and understand this story as your own. -- Terrence Malick

In his filmography Malick develops the concept of *grace* and *nature* which is most prominent in *The Tree of Life*.
I would argue that *nature* is closely related to the *essence of technology* being the instrumental and rational aspect of seeing and thinking.
Malick's *nature* is calculating, selfish, and alien---it fights and dominates to survive; the wolf hunting the lamp, land fighting the ocean, plants fighting plants, humans dominating humans in

>physical life in a world abandoned by the spirit. Organized unreality. The soul a hindrance in oneâ€™s dealings here. A burden. A mere quantity of thoughts and desires. -- Terrence Malick

*Grace*, on the other hand, is forgiving, vulnerable, selfless, playful, and intimate.
It is the spiritual which, for Malick, seem to erode out of the limits of understanding.
Some call its source God, but Malick notes:

>Let us sing a new song, tell a new story; one which, mindful of the ancient tales, takes its inspiration from science. Let us search for the permanent amid the fleeting and mutable, for that which endures through the spectacle of ceaseless change. Let us discover the eternal, the good. -- Terrence Malick

For Malick, creation is eternal birth.
A beginning without end.
It happens in every instant of time.
The same power which burns the stars burns equally in us.
Our being is a miracle, equal with the creation of the universe, and like the universe, each day is created anew.

In *The Thin Red Line* we can observe the soldiers which are *thrown* onto a Pacific island in World War II and are aware of the thin line between *Being* and *Nothing*.
Nowhere in Malick's works is the transitory nature of the world more thoroughly explored than in this movie.
Theses soldiers struggle with existential questions and anxiety because they are forcefully confronted with death; they imagine their life from the end---what Heidegger called *Vorlaufen zum eigenen Tode*.
The American and Japanese soldiers as well as the Melanesian people caught in the middle of a conflict represent a reminder of our constant vulnerability to the collapse of our way of life, i.e., our existential fragility of human worlds.
For the philosopher Dreyfus the film is a concrete and historical example of the freedom of *Dasein* at work, a clear example of the groundless ground of human
action.
According to {cite}`woessner:2011`, *The Thin Red Line* shows us not just the world of the battle but at least three other worlds.
Its central aim to investigate the meaning of the world itself, something connected to mortality, but not defined entirely and solely by it.
In that sense, it is not only a film of a battle between nations but a clash of different worlds.
It is also a film about our increasing inability to recognize that the world itself is a delicate and fragile balance predicated on, but ultimately pointing beyond, human agency.

According to the topic of the *essence of technology* Malick's *The New World* might be closest to the question at hand.
What *The New World* recounts is the transformation of the natural world into an artificial world.
Scenes of indigenous dwelling are juxtaposed with scenes of colonial misery, the former depicting balance and harmony with the environment, the latter only struggle and strife---existence against, not with, nature.
Malick uses the Pocahonta-myth to explore the origins of modern world, in which mortals begin to exaggerate their role in the delicate and fragile interaction of the interaction between the earth, the sky, divinities, and mortals---throwing it off balance.
An uprooted Pocahontas wanders through the rationalized English garden, perplexed by how the Europeans have tamed and reshaped the trees of nature.
We can suggest that the colonists brought not only industry and civilization but also the metaphysics that created the objective and rational world, i.e. Decartes's philosophy, and with the *essence of technology*---seeing the world as *standing reserve*.
In this way, America comes into being.

And in his latest work *A Hiden Life*, Malick seems to try to find a moral compass within Heidegger's work by deconstructing religion and nationalism by looking at someone who refuses to fight.
It is a film about goodness and courage, without recognition.
An attempt that is more close to Kierkegaard and goes probably against Heidegger's intentions because he seems to provide no such compass or moral considerations.
Here we find an *ordinary* farmer with a profoundly unspectacular life.
He follows his convictions absolutely with little impact apart from his and his family's destiny.
Malick transforms the *ordinary* into the *extraordinary* by letting *Being* show up.
The farm life has importance, as part of the larger creation.
We experience the farmer in his web of practical tools, labour and *earth*.
The film also provides us with scenes where we can feel the filmmaker's own wrestling with Heidegger's legacy as a *Nazi*.
And, of course, a world breaks down forever.

It is in our human nature to love the story of a person who did great things: saved lives, wrote books, stood against the dictator who wiped out millions of lives.
It is less common for us to celebrate a man or woman who threw away a good life and simply refused to do what he knew he could not, and paid with his life.
*A Hidden Life* dares us to imagine that the latter is at least as important as the former---and maybe more so.

Most certainly, Malick's works questions that we ought to have made ourselves answer.
Undoubtedly, they are important questions since they get to the heart of *disengagement* and *alienation*.
These are inherently modern questions, unfamiliar to traditional societies and cultures.
They are also questions one asks only in a state of anxiety.
And knowing the world and being open to the terror of anxiety were two sides of the same coin.

>The growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs. -- Mary Anne Evans (George Eliot)

Next I want to include Michael Haneke because he, like no one else, uses film to unconceal the *blurriness* of reality and contemporary cinema.
It's probably more Luhmannian cinema than Heidegerrian.

>It's the duty of art to ask questions, not to provide answers. And if you want a clearer answer, I'll have to pass. -- Michael Haneke

For Haneke there is not one truth but there are a thousand.
It's a question of viewpoint which truth you accept; whether you want it or whether you refuse it.
This is fundamentally what he is trying to show: to grasp, to some extent, the contradictory nature of reality because reality is always contradictory and never clear.
The work of Haneke challenges the notion that film and reality are mirror images of one another.

He suggests that the creation of film has in fact reworked what we consider reality.
He creates very real *worlds* but making us aware that they aren't real at all.
By doing so Haneke exposes the dangerous effect of an existence informed by media worship implying that a worldwide trivialization of emotion has been instigated through the disassociation with reality.
He shows deep seeded interest in the world beyond what we see at the screen.
By framing subjects out of the line of sight or using off-screen sounds, he draws attention to the materiality outside of the frame.
This is the place where the most traumatic events occur.
Thereby, Haneka is bringing into question the context of an image.
If we are aware of violence but are incapable of seeing it, is that image still violent?
If we spent our time surrounded by real acts of terror in our media, does this makes our life terrifying?
Personal stories bleed into social decay and vice versa.
One can not exist without the other.
And to lack an understanding of the coherence of both is Haneke's way of communicating the failure of communication in societies.
The necessity of creating secrets in his work is to establish an interior not known by those outside of the circle.

In his work he establishes that copies of reality erode the walls between the real and the imaginary leading to Baudrillard's *hyper-real*.
A prime example is the effect of the new *Barbie* movie.
It is no longer the case that Barbie is a mirror of humanity, i.e., constructed in our image, but instead humans constructing themselves as Barbie---life imitates advertisement.
In itself this is neither good nor bad but it should give us thought for pause.
If reality imitates media, we should be aware of what we consume!

In *Funny Games*, Haneke shows us senseless violence like we see in so many movies today.
But his violence is violent.
It hurts, it is unpleasant, disturbing, and soul crushing.
While watching the movie one wants to scream towards the protagonists but one has to keep watching helplessness.
Leonard Maltin called the movie ``nonsensical and highly unpleasant'' but that is exactly the point.
Haneke wants to provoke and he wants to deconstruct the violent cinema.
And he won't give as relief, causal rationalization, or the morally guilty.
Violence stays brutally nonsensical.
Only we as audience seem to be guilty of consuming it.

Haneka's films explore the notion of not addressing truth and rather looking outward.
As viewers, we 'enjoy' the pain of not knowing.
Perhaps we are unable to dissect the connotations of his images  because we are unable to understand the reality of that *world*.
Just as the images of our reality are incapable of being communicated with our subject.
In a sense, Haneka teaches us more complex ways of reading images by displaying a world as close to reality as possible---something almost anti-cinema.
The emergence of reality becomes the destruction of the fantasy.
He disrupts the traditional filming methods to raise the awareness that the film spectator is the consumer that all images are addressed to.
He leads us as an audience from the notion of the true image into perspectives of plural truth.
He presents us the reality of people's life, yet puts us at a physical distance so that we may remain 'objective' towards it.
His work is unfulfilling and shows how cinema primes us to an Utopian vision of reality where all problems are resolved and a chain of causality is present.
Haneka highlights this cloud of untruth.
There is no single explanation of human suffering, it just is---all that remain is what we do with it.

I find Haneke's project important.
However, if such an unconcealment of the *hyper-real* is possible, or if even the most unpleasant depiction of violence in reference to the medium itself, e.g. by breaking the fourth wall, will lead to the same old effect, that is, more violence, is questionable.

I think, similar to the Greek temple, films from these directors can open worlds by bringing us back into existential time, i.e., bringing us to reflecting on (our) *Being* or what it means to be.
And when this question shines through, it can upset our entire world.
It can make us question every aspect of our being.
This "feeling" is defined by a particular type of *anxiety* (*Angst*) or *dread*, which according to Heidegger, is the only human emotion that is unbound from our world.
It calls into question all of our everyday assumptions about the world around us and, perhaps more importantly, about our place in the world.
This experience of *world collapse* is equivalent to the realization that the center no longer holds, that the shared understanding that defines our space of meaning and understanding no longer exists.
It can be triggered by external events that awaken us from practicality into awareness and contemplation---by the failing or surprising equipment---so to speak.
The feeling itself is not related to anything concrete.
Instead, it is defined by an absence.
It relates to the nothing---to the void.
When the noise no longer drowns out the inner voice, a dialogue with our own mortality begins.
This is what these works depict but also can cause to the observing audience.
They are good examples of the struggle between *world* and *earth*.
They are never semiotically exhausted or depleted, i.e., finally made totally intelligible.

Overall Heidegger's view on art is interesting but seems also quite narrow.
There is much to be gleaned from Kant's idea of *aesthetics* being a subjective judgment of taste.
We cannot ignore that a beautiful form can also be shown to be an attribute of art. 
That isn't to say that aesthetics has it right either, however, to completely ignore it cuts short all that art can be.
I would also say the portrayal of a *world* isn't always clearly evident in every work of art either.
If you listen to a piece of music---uniquely both: completely abstract and profoundly emotional---particularly one without lyrics, is a whole world evident in its make-up?
If not, does this mean it is not a work of art?

>God has given us music so that above all it can lead us upwards. Music unites all qualities: it can exalt us, divert us, cheer us up, or break the hardest of hearts with the softest of its melancholy tones. But its principal task is to lead our thoughts to higher things, to elevate, even to make us tremble [...] The musical art often speaks in sounds more penetrating than the words of poetry, and takes hold of the most hidden crevices of the hear [...] Song elevates our being and leads us to the good and the true. If, however, music serves only as a diversion or as a kind of vain ostentation it is sinful and harmful. -- (a very young) Friedrich Nietzsche

Heidegger's description of art seems ancient.
As already discussed, a more explainable but also abstract framework was presented by Niklas Luhman, for example in his text *[Medium and Form](sec-medium-and-form)* {cite}`luhmann:1986`.
What I take from Heidegger is that art can unconceal *world* and *earth*.
Furthermore, I think that art can elucidate the *essence of technology*, enabling us to develop an open relationship with it.
A piece of art can expose our uncertainty about whether technology can be disregarded, or whether it embodies a seductive cosmic force that we're incapable of resisting.
It can set up a new meaning-giving world and, according Tarkovsky, can ultimately prepares us for death.

>The allotted function of art is not, as is often assumed, to put across ideas, to propagate thoughts, to serve as example.
>The aim of art is to prepare a person for death, to plough and harrow his soul, rendering it capable of turning to good. -- Andrei Tarkovsky
