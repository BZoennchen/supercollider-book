# Introduction

It's almost embarrassing for me to reflect on my journey and realize that in some ways, I haven't moved closer to the truth. 
I recall being around ten years old, pondering my existence and the nature of reality. Perhaps such questioning is inherent to humanity, but I should refrain from attributing our human essence to a singular principle. 
Admittedly, I now understand more about *how things function*, but I remain clueless about *the true nature of reality*.

From this lack of certainty and clearness it seems natural that one starts doubting the direct access to an objective reality.
Such thing might be ontological 'true' but we can not know and we can not access it.
However, then I think about the *unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics* and say to myself: There has to be at least traces of an objective reality.
How can it be that mathematics never let's us down?
This ambivalence feels akin to being torn between the philosophies of early and late Wittgenstein or caught between the thoughts of Russell and Nietzsche.

My unease grows when I pair this ambiguity with the recent advances in technology and societal shifts.
If contemporary philosophers challenge the validity of metaphysical assertions, how then should we deal with *cybernetics*---modern technology that *steers* us into the future, often backed by these very metaphysical claims?
If *philosophy* is in fact like *poetry* as Richard Rorty {cite}`rorty:2016` suggests, i.e. a historical, inexhaustible narrative that can be contextualized and re-contextualized in a never ending cycle, then it's crucial that we maintain our capacity for vivid, life-affirming *imagination*.
Rorty suggests that instead of seeing some cultural elements as more aligned with reality than others, we might measure the strength and potential of our imaginations, and subsequently, the quality of life they can bring about. 
In contrast, I think that the *convergence of cybernetics* and what many term *surveillance capitalism* confines our imaginative potential.
True progress, or the pursuit of a better life, necessitates viewing technology as a determining factor for the horizon of the possible---that which we can imagine.

Marshall McLuhan, the acclaimed "high priest of pop culture and meta-physician of the media" from the 1960s, famously proclaimed that "the medium is the message". McLuhan's work blended philosophy with literature, pop culture, and media analysis. Rather than focusing on the content of communication, he posited that the medium itself---be it the internet, radio, or television---in other words, the technology, is what truly matters.

>The message of TV is quite independent of the program. The effect of the program is incidental. -- Marshall McLuhan

In this part of the book, I will elucidate his thesis that technology uniquely shapes humanity. 
Moreover, I aim to go beyond simply examining how different technologies influence and transform our lives.
Instead, I will delve into whether and how technology, as a mode of existence, also defines the boundaries of our imagination.
Finally, I will discuss the role of art in this context.

In the spirit of *Philosophy of Poetry* {cite}`rorty:2016`, I urge the reader to take this text not something close to metaphysics but as a narrative or a theory that only tries to help to imagine what technology is or better how it works.

>[The highest human being, deludes himself]: he calls his nature contemplative and thereby overlooks the fact that he is also the actual poet and ongoing author of life [...].
>It is we, the thinking-sensing ones, who really and continually make something that is not yet there: the whole perpetually growing would of valuations, colors, weights, perspectives, scales, affirmations, and negations.
>This poem that we have invented is constantly internalized, drilled, translated into flesh and reality, indeed, into the commonplace, by the so-called practical human beings.
>Only we have created the world that concerns human beings!\, -- Friedrich Nietzsche {cite}`nietzsche:1882`
