# Chords

Similar to diatonic scale where notes are numbered from one to seven, we also use numbers to denote the position of a chord relative to its key (e.g. scale of key E).
The most prominant chords called *triads* consist of three notes, where we start at some note and take two times every other note.
In other words, chords are fully defined by the used *key* and a combination of degrees (*scale note positions*).
If $d$ is the degree of the first note then

$$(d, d+2, d+4)$$

constitute a *triad*.
For example, for a major scale in the key of C (all white key on a piano),

$$(\text{E, G, B})$$

constitutes the iii-minor scale within this key.
Roman numerals (I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi, vii) are used to label chord positions.
We use capitalized roman numerals if we refer to a major chord, otherwise we use lowercase numerals.
The numbers translate to the degrees of the key.
In the following first table I use the major scale in the key of A:

| Major Key | I     | ii    | iii   | IV    | V     | vi    | vii           |
| --------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------------- |
|           | major | minor | minor | major | major | minor | diminished    |
| Intervals | 4,3   | 3,4   | 3,4   | 4,3   | 4,3   | 3,4   | 3,3           |
| A major   | A     | B     | C#    | D     | E     | F#    | G#            |

In the second table I use the minor scale in the key of A:

| Minor Key | i     | ii         | III   | iv    | v     | VI    | VII   |
| --------- | ----- | ---------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------|
|           | minor | diminished | major | minor | minor | major | major |
| Intervals | 3,4   | 3,3        | 4,3   | 3,4   | 3,4   | 4,3   | 4,3   |
| A minor   | A     | B          | C     | D     | E     | F     | G     |

Following the formula, we call (B, D, F#) the *B minor* (in the key of major A) and (D, F, A) the *D major* (in the key of minor A).
Note that all *triads within a key* are unique.
In a major key, a major chord is defined an interval order of (4,3), the minor chord is defined by (3,4) and the deminished is defined by (3,3).
If we look at all resulting intervals for the major and minor chord we get: 3 semitones (**minor third**), 4 semitones **major third** and 7 semitones (**perfect fifth**).
In frequencies of an equally tempered octave this equates to 

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
2^{3/12} &\approx 1.189 \approx 1.2,\\
2^{4/12} &\approx 1.259 \approx 1.25,\\
2^{7/12} &\approx 1.498 \approx 1.5.
\end{split}
\end{equation}

All these ratios are relatively simple; thus, the tone is consonant. For the diminished chord, we get two intervals of 3 semitones (**minor third**) and an interval of 6 semitones (**minor seventh**) resulting tone a little more dissonant.
In frequencies of an equally tempered octave this equates to 

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
2^{3/12} &\approx 1.189 \approx 1.2,\\
2^{6/12} &\approx 1.4142 \approx 1.25.
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Note that we can categorize the chord into major, minor, or diminished solely by the *interval order*.
Therefore, a chord is fully defined by this order and the first note.
Consequently, we do not know the *key*.
We can name the chord by the *first note* and the *interval order*, e.g., B minor chord (*Bm*) is equal to (B, D, F#).
Musicians use only the note symbol, such as F, to denote the major chord of that note, e.g., F major.
This can be confusing because scales and keys are denoted similarily.

By relating chords via a *chord progression* they can have different types of emotional effects across a piece of music.

Consonant
: A stable or relaxing sound which can be used to begin or end a piece of music (*major/minor*)

Dissonant
: An unstable (tension producing) sound which wants to resolve back into stability (*augmented/diminished*)
