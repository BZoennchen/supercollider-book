# Modes

Starting a scale from other than degree 1 or 6 produces additional scales that share the diatonic interval order.
These variations are called *modes*.
We also get the different modes by shifting the *interval order* of the *diatonic scale*.
Its initial degree is called *final* because typically, music in a mode would end on that note.
Major and minor scales are synonyms for *Ionian* and *Aeolian modes* -- a quite elaborate naming convention.
