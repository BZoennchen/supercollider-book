# Composing

The process of composing, and deciding how to go about it, can be one of the most challenging things about SuperCollider.
The jump from modifying simple examples to producing a full-scale piece can be tough because there is no single or best way to do things.
We run into the *burden of freedom*.
SuperCollider offers very different ways to accomplish composition.
It is the responsibility of the artist to find their own coding style.
In contrast to *digital audio workstations (DAWs)* such as *Reason* or *Ableton*, SC does not present the user with a *preferred* way of working.
This can be not very clear, but it is an inevitable side effect of the flexibility and freedom SuperCollider provides.
Many different approaches are feasible to generate and assemble a composition.
Consequently, showing an extensive list of different techniques is impossible and undesirable.
But I will try to give you some starting points.
