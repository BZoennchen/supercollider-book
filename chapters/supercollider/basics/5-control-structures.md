# Control Structures

In ``sclang``, control sequences are functions.
They expect one or multiple functions that are executed conditionally.
We already saw the ``if``-function, which expect one boolean expression (a predicate) and two functions.

The ``while``-function expects one predicate and another function that can be executed as long as the predicate is true.
For example:

```isc
(
var i = 0;
while({i < 10}, {i.postln; i = i + 1;});
)
```

The ``for``-function works much more restricted:

```isc
(
for(0, 9, {arg i; i.postln;})
)
```

A little more flexible is the ``forBy``-function for which ``for`` is a special case.
It allows us to define an additional ``stepValue``:

```isc
(
forBy(0, 9, 2, {arg i; i.postln;}) // 0 2 4 6 8
)
```

The ``do``-function iterates over a given sequence, similar to a ``foreach`` of other languages (``for`` in ``Python``).

```isc
(
do((1..9), {arg item, i; item.post; ",".post; i.postln;})
)
```

Here ``item`` is the element of the ``Array`` generated by ``(1..9)`` and ``i`` is the index of the element!

A ``switch``-function expects a ``value`` and pairs of tested values and functions to be executed.
The test checks for equality ``==``.
To be more flexible and to use different predicates one can use the ``case``-function which is as efficient as ``if``-statements.
