# Scheduling

In computer science *scheduling* is the process (realized by the *scheduler*) of establishing an execution order of processes that can be executed.
In general we consider an *online* setting where processes being executed while the *scheduler* is active.
Either the *scheduler* runs in parallel or sequencially, i.e. it is interrupted by the processes it schedules.

Composing music via code involves the scheduling of musical events via algorithms where an algorithm can be interpreted as a descriptions of a scheduler.
But it is more than that.
It has a special relation with time.
