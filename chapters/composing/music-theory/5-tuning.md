# Tuning

*Pythagoreans* were obsessed with *simple ratios*, i.e., ratios formed by small prime numbers.
They build a *just-tuning* by using these ratios, which lead to a strong dissonance for some combinations of notes.
In 1584 *Zhu Zaiyu* achieved an exact calculation of the well-known *twelve-tone equal temperament tuning (12-TET)* in China.
One year later, the Flemish mathematician *Simon Stevin* was also able to develop this flexible *tuning*.
Instead of using *simple ratios* *equal temperament tunings*, use real numbers such that an *octave* is divided in equally tempered (equally spaced) on a logarithmic scale.
In the case of the *twelve-tone*, the ratio is equal to the 12th root of 2, i.e.,

\begin{equation}
    \sqrt[12]{2} = 2^{1/12} \approx 1.05946.
\end{equation}

In modern times, 12-TET is usually tuned relative to a standard pitch of 440 Hz, called A440.
Note A is tuned to 440 hertz, and all other notes are defined as some multiple of semitones apart from it, either higher or lower in frequency.
However, the standard pitch has not always been 440 Hz, and there is still a lot of dispute and discussion.
This development is a comparatively recent development in the musical community, and the agreement is still fragile among musicians {cite}`loy:2006`.

Interstingly, if we look at the intervals between harmonics we spot *simple ratios* for 12-TET.
From the fundamental $\omega$ to the first overtone $2\omega$ we get the ratio $2/1$.
From the first $2\omega$ to the second overtone $3\omega$ we get another simple ratio, i.e., $3/2$ following the intervals $4/3$, $5/4$ and $6/5$.
In general the $i$-th interval is equal to 

\begin{equation}
    \frac{i+1}{i},
\end{equation}

which gives us *simple ratios* for small $i$.
