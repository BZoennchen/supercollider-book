# Introduction

This part of the book is optional. 
It represents my attempt to understand various philosophical and societal concepts that I was considering during the time I was writing the book. 
These are my personal thoughts, and I encourage readers to critically reflect on these matters.

Since the book discusses a particular type of technology that, in my view, creates opportunities for creative work, I wanted to delve into the relationship between technology, art, and ourselves. Of course, this perspective is not objective. 
It is influenced by my personal experiences, cultural background, and overall environment.
