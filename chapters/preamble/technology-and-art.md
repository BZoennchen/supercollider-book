# Technology and Art

Marshall McLuhan, the acclaimed "high priest of pop culture and metaphysician of the media" from the 1960s, famously proclaimed that "the medium is the message".
McLuhan's work blended philosophy with literature, pop culture, and media analysis.
Rather than focusing on the content of communication, he posited that the medium itself—--be it the internet, radio, or television—--in other words, the technology, is what truly matters.

>The message of TV is quite independent of the program.
>The effect of the program is incidental. -- Marshall McLuhan

In this section, I try to explain his thesis that technology shapes humans in a new way.
In addition, I want to extend beyond questioning how various technologies shape and reshape our lives, and instead explore whether and how technology, as a *mode of existence*, also sets the horizon of our imagination.
Lastly, I want to touch on the role of art in all of this.

## Technological Art

I gave the example of works of Tarkovsky and Malick because film is of course highly technological.
Both directors offer us worlds to be viewed but these worlds are constructed by technological manipulations.
They both work in a medium made possible by technology but this relation is hidden.
These movies, created by huge amount of material in form of capital, machines, and people present worlds and simultaneously conceal their own origin---their own world of lenses, cameras, cuts and studios.
This raises a question: Can the material or the medium of the artwork be technological or is any attempt to create art via modern technology doomed to fail?

Walter Benjamin remarks in his highly influential *The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction* {cite}`benjamin:1936` that

>we can see the brushstrokes in the painting or inhabit the spaces and places made possible by architecture but film [and other artworks making use of modern technology] appears before us magically, as if independent of the massive process that actually manufactured it. -- Walter Benjamin

Even though these thinkers are quite different, similar to Heidegger, Benjamin thought of the loss of *authenticity*.
Even the perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element: its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be.
The ability for artworks to be copied---to be everywhere---produces new possibilities but represses something too: its *aura*.

>[This] shattering of tradition, [... this] renewal of mankind, [... are] intimately connected with the contemporary mass movements. -- Walter Benjamin

For Benjamin, the *aura* is like the unique ritualistic aspect of a work of art---art for art sake or cultish art.
But, for him, the loss of *aura* comes with new possibilities.
Art has changed from being an art for and by the elites to art for and by the masses.
Film, for example, opens a window for the alienated workers to experience other worlds and concepts.
As a Marxist, he thought of art's revolutionary potential because due to mass production, art became much more political; the possibility to change material realities through art appeared to be a realistic goal.
He even thought that distraction can be revolutionary.
By being distracted away from their own thought means the audience absorbs the art, the habits the filmmaker intends.
Today it is safe to say that he would be robbed of his hope.

>In prehistoric times [art], by the absolute emphasis on its cult value [...] was, first and foremost, an instrument of magic. [...] Today, by the absolute emphasis on its exhibition value the work of art becomes a creation with entirely new functions [... as exemplified by] photography and film. -- Walter Benjamin

Benjamin was certainly ahead of his time.
He already became aware that art is now also a kind of *spectacle*.
He expressed an awareness of art in media being used for simulating a sort of *hyper-reality*, a term coined by the *postmodern* thinker Jean Baudrillard.
Artworks tend to being *simulacra*, i.e., copies without originals.
Furthermore, Benjamin saw that art was and will be captured by capitalism to serve as the means to produce a brand, or in today's term: a *profile*.
The authentic *substantiality* of art is lost---or in Heidegger's terms: *earth* is fully concealed.

But again, for Banjamin this is not necessarily a bad thing.
Distinct from what I read into Heidegger, there is no nostalgia of the loss of *authenticity*.
For him, the loss of *aura* and the loss of *authenticity* is *cathartic* because it liberates and democratizes art.
It takes art out of the hand of the elites, sof to say, and makes it accessible to the people.
Art becomes mass-produced, mass-consumed, mass-participatory, and mass-criticized.

>For the first time in world history, mechanical reproduction emancipates the work of art from its parasitical dependence on ritual. -- Walter Benjamin

Benjamin also analyzed how fascism utilizes mass production and how art must counter it.
He argues that fascism gives expression to the proletariat---to the masses---without changing the economic structure.
The bourgeoisie, the Führer, and the cult holds its place while only representing the masses.
The logical result of fascism is the introduction of aesthetics into political life.
If technology is not used for positive purposes it utilizes aesthetic form for the expansion of man's domination, his imperialist expansion.
Here we find crossovers with Heidegger but, with respect to technology, Benjamin gives humans much more agency than Heidegger does.
Benjamin wanted to change our worldview to change the material world.
But to give the masses expression without change was, for him, the formula of fascism.

From a contemporary perspective, we can say that the new media were not bringing about a communist utopia.
Furthermore, the facist appropriation of art, while it had its catastrophic time, is hopefully a thing of history.
Instead, today, new media and, within new media, art often serves the *curation of profiles* on an individual as well as collective or institutional level---it neither functions in the context of communism nor of fascism but, in most cases, it serves *capitalism*.

Heidegger thought that when we humans came at last to see ourselves as living *on* a world, we had finally replaced any notion of dwelling with a rationalist, external, and objectified vision of existence.
The fundamental event that marks this transition, he proclaimed, is the conquest of the *world as picture* which points to the *hyper-real* of Baudrillard.
It is hard to say if this really happened.
I doubt that human beings today are only capable of an objectified vision of existence precisely because we are capable of ingraining ourselves into new grounds even if these grounds are virtual.
Like *mere technology* so is the technological creation of art not the problem.
A picture of a pair of shoes projected onto a screen can open up a world of the farmer who is wearing those shoes and it can still unconceal *earth*.
However, copies without origins can not.
They stay, so to say, *ready-to-hand* and never appear to us as *present-at-hand*.

In an reaction to Benjamin's essay Douglas Davis argues in *The Work of Art in the Age of Digital Reproduction* that "art, in the traditional realm, is a commodity that must pretend to universality.
It must reach out to touch many fingers, not just yours or mine."
While Benjamin was in support of technological production of art in the sense that it would *touch many fingers*, he was certainly worried of art as a commercial product which purpose it is to make a profit or make one successful.
He wanted political and progressive material change via the visions, i.e. *worlds*, *unconcealed* by art.
He would probably also align with Tarkovsky as seeing art as the possibility of spiritual grows but of the people and not of a few elites.

The focus on profit might completely push the artist out of the picture which would, according to Heidegger, render art impossible, since art and the artist are interdependent.
Of course, there are enough people who believe, especially in these days, that the human artist is a superfluous burden.
This sentiment was perfectly articulated by Steven Bartlett on his podcast:

>I wonder if we are a little bit delusional about what creativity actually is. Creativity [...] is like taking a view things that I know and combine them in new and interesting ways.
>Generative AI is perfectly capable of taking two concepts and merging them together.
>So this Abba show in London [...] is all holograms on stage and it is gonna run in a purposeful arena for ten years and it is incredible.
>So why do you need Drake? 
>If that hologram is indistinguishable from Drake and it can perform even better than Drake and it's got more energy than Drake, why do you need Drake to even be there?
>I can go to a Drake show without Drake, it is even cheaper. -- Steven Bartlett

I do not want to go into the topic of *creativity* but, to me, art is not the product of some sort of scientific experiment where you put a bunch of ingredients in and get some optimal output.
In fact, as we discussed, it is quite the opposite.
Furthermore, it is not about *creativity* (which certainly helps), i.e. creating something creative that is surprising and entertaining in the most optimal why.
Great works of art show *truth*; they reveal something of significance.
For some it shows the inner world of the artists, for others it shows another world.
The important quality of artists is their capacity to see new worlds without fully understanding them. 
On a more existential note works of art should also serve life.
And I suggest that Tarkovsky's view on art as the preparation for death is life serving.

>Art approaches as a saving sorceress, expert at healing. She alone knows how to tum these nauseous thoughts about the horror or absurdity of existence into notions with which one can live: these are the sublime as the artistic taming of the horrible, and the comic as the artistic discharge of the nausea of absurdity. -- Friedrich Nietzsche

With this in mind, let us look at recent examples of highly technologized artworks.
Take, for example, these new immersive Van Gogh exhibitions which animate Van Gogh's works within a room accentuate with music where you can interact with the artwork.

>In a multimedia light installation, the visitor is immersed in Van Gogh's works and experiences the virtual illusion as reality. The paintings are brought to life with the help of oversized projections and video animations in combination with soulful melodies. No detail of the famous works of art remains hidden from the visitor. Van Gogh's works such as the world-famous "Sunflowers", "The Night Café", "The Starry Night", "The Potato Eaters" or the "Bedroom in Arles" can be experienced from a completely new perspective. The viewer is in the midst of the paintings, he becomes part of the scenery, immersed in light and sound, the works of art interact with him. -- Website of The Van Goth Experience

You can experience the artworks in new and probably interesting ways.
But is this art?
There is a reason why Van Gogh's paintings are enframed, i.e. distanced from the artworks environment, and why they are static, that is, snapshots of a world.
This distance between the artwork and the observer vanishes here, similar to the distance of the hammer which is *ready-to-hand*.

>This exhibition is a completely new multimedia spectacle that presents the world-famous artworks of the Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh (1853 – 1890) in a way never seen before: "Van Gogh – The Immersive Experience". -- Website of The Van Goth Experience

It is true that there is a “new multimedia spectacle,” but it doesn't "present Van Gogh’s artworks" as if the original is somehow "updated" or "improved".
It's a completely different work, and I would argue one that lacks the ability of unconcealing the *earth* for the benefit of being *spectacular*.
While the experience it might have a healing effect and serve life, I'm skeptical. 
Instead of art for art's sake, or art with a cultish or exhibitionist nature, these exhibitions seem to be mere exhibitions for the sake of exhibitions.

I am interested in unconcealing technology---to make it visible and a matter of deep thought.
Can digital art do the trick?
We might ask: What is the matter of such a digital artwork generated by an [algorithm](sec-algorithms)?
According to Heidegger, Van Gogh's painting of the farmer's shoes unconceals the shoe's *Being*---its truth.
In similar fashion, a painting of an atomic plant can unconceal the plant to us.
However, *The Van Goth Experience*, similar to a movie, conceals technology rather than revealing it.
That is not to say that these artworks can not unconceal other worlds.
The problem is that in these cases technology is the equipment *ready-to-hand*.
But what if an *algorithmic artwork* doesn't represent anything but its own creation?
Isn't it the case that, in this case, *algorithmic art* can unconceal the algorithm's truth?
I argue that precisely because of its uselessness (with respect to equipment) the algorithm becomes *present-at-hand*.
*Code*, eletrical circuits and energy is its *earth* (*Heimat*).
In a live setting, i.e. when doing *live programming*, we get another dimension because in this setting the unexpected looms in the darkness.
If things go wrong the equipment (laptops, code, etc.) introduce itself---the technological world appears. 
That is why I find *algorithmic art* so interesting.

To summarize let me come back to the core question of this section: Are we part of the problem when attempting to create art using technology such as the one introduced in this book or the one popping up all over the internet, that is, *generative artificial intelligence*?
After giving it some thought, this is still hard to answer.
For me, experiencing Malick's (technological) movies elicited a sort of meditation on *Being* which hardly any other artwork could achieved.
I think we have to differentiate between *abstraction* and *objectification*.
While the two go hand in hand, they are not equivalent.
Music is the best example for that, it is abstract but also subjective.
The abstract is also not detached from the unexplainable.
To say that great music is not art seems to be a crime.
Furthermore, I see potential in *algorithmic art* to unconceal technology but only if the *algorithmic artwork* represents its own creation.

From Benjamin I take that technology changed the creation, consumption and evaluation of art into a mass-event.
The *aura*, in many cases, is lost.
Instead of *exchange value* artworks have now *symbolic value* that no longer symbolize anything mysticaland or incomprehensible.
They often no longer stand for themselves but, like Heidegger's equipment which is interconnected within a web of tools, practices and purposes, artworks (as products) are more and more interconnected to other signifiers and derive their meaning not by unconcealing *earth* and *worlds* but their connection within this web---like words in a language but with the exception that these symbols are not grounded in anything "earthly" (heimatlich).
In Luhmann's terminology, contemporary artworks are forms of society (understood as all of communication).
From Nietzsche and Tarkovsky I take that it is enough for art to serve life.
