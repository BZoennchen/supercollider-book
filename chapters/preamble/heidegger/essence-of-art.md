# The Essence of Art

If, at this point, you get an idea of Heidegger's phenomenologically thinking, it should be no surprise that for him, not only is the artist the *cause* of the work, but the work, in turn, is the *cause* of the artist.

>The artist is the origin of the work. The work is the origin of the artist. Neither is without the other. Nevertheless, neither is the sole support of the other. In themselves and in their interrelations artist and work *are* each of them by virtue of a third thing which is prior to both, namely, that which also gives artist and work of art their names---art. -- Martin Heidegger

Art, as a *mode of Being*, makes both artist and artwork ontologically possible.
And if we are to discover the *essence of art* we must discover it by phenomenologically investigating artworks, but here we arrive at a *strange loop*, i.e., a paradox since what art is should be inferable from the work but what the work is, we can come to know only from the *essence of art*.
These *loops* remind me of Hofstadter's self-referential and paradoxical *strange loops* from his book *Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid* {cite}`hofstadter:1979`.
And it was Husserl (and to an extend Kierkegaard) who already thought of consciousness (or the self) as a *strange loop* relating itself to itself and constantly going back and forth between seeing phenomena and self-relating---a never ending circle which constitutes consciousness seemingly out of nothing.
I think what Heidegger means is that we are thrown into a process that already started.
We enter the circle at some point and move on it which will reveal both the *artist* and the *artwork* more and more but this process never ends.
What an artist and the artwork is, is never fully defined.

To talk about art in an Heidegerian sense, I have to clarify what he understands by tools and objects.
Heidegger differentiates between what others may call "substances"---that are more thing-like and *present-at-hand* (*vorhanden*) entities (raw material, stones, water in a river, etc.)---and tools or equipment (useful things) that are generally *ready-to-hand* (*zuhanden*) and connected within a network of other tools and purposes.
Interestingly, in his view, artworks are *present-at-hand*, i.e., have a very thingly character.
This seems to be a gross reduction of artworks.
How can it be that the great works of art are like a purposeless stone in a see of stones?
Isn't *a thing* anything?
Surely tools are things and stones are things and dirt is a thing but a tool is more than a thing.
I will come back to this "issue".

>There is something stony in a work of architecture, wooden in a carving, colored in a painting, spoken in a linguistic work, sonorous in a musical composition. -- Martin Heidegger

In my view, great artworks reveal a mystical truth that is unexplainable; these works let us question without ever coming to a final conclusion.
They escape language or any other abstraction or symbolic representation.
Any analysis or critique has to be incomplete and shallow of what the artwork is.
Therefore, if the *essence of technology* is *enframing* (Gestell) (with the human subject at its center) then the *essence of art* might be the opposite.
It might be that which can not be *enframed* and which is able to unconceal a new *horizon of possibilities*.
In fact, Heidegger argues in his essay *The Origin of the Work of Art* {cite}`heidegger:1950` that

>to be a work [of art] means to set up a world. -- Martin Heidegger

In other words, *setting up of a world* is one of the essential feature of the *Being of the work of art*.
This is close to Luhmann's view when he says that art forms its medium to create a contingent alternative version of reality.

But what does Heidegger mean by that?
Let us look at Heidegger's example of a Greek temple.
The Greek temple brought about a world---it is an event of truth.
The temple, in its standing there, first gives to things their look and to men their outlook on themselves.
The Greek temple set up a world that organized and stabilized the lives of the Greeks; it was that by which they made sense out of their existence.
Medieval cathedrals did the exact some thing for Christians and the great mosque did the same for Muslims.

Heidegger chooses the ancient temple because it is non-representational, therefore, preventing the erecting of a *world* being understood solely as representation.
A statue within the temple might represent the gods but the wall, and the stones that make up the wall do not represent anything.
Another example he brought up is Van Gogh's painting of a farmer's shoes.
One might say that the painting represent the shoes but this is not the main point of the artwork.

Notice that *world* is not the objective reality of the universe but the significant, contextual network of references through which *Dasein* can take the stand on its *Being* that it does (be the specific person that it is), as well as have the *style* of *Being* that it has.
The temple gathers the possibilities of the Greek people who live around it, governing over the ideas of birth and death, managing victory and causing decline---that is the *world* the temple opens.
The world is the self-opening openness of the broad paths of the simple and essential decisions in the destiny of a historical people.
Sandra Lee Bartky has summed it up well in the following way:

>Heidegger’s use of the term "world" carries with it the sense not only of *life-world* (*Lebenswelt*) but of *historical epoch* as well, with the suggestion that the life-world is an historical structure. -- Sandra Lee Bartky

Husserl came to believe that the *world* was what we have in common---a universal horizon but one rooted in a shared, existential space, what he called *Lebenswelt* (life-world).
But who creates or sustains this horizon?
This, in short, was Heidegger's question to his former mentor.
For Heidegger, the nature or the limits of the world were less important than the practical experience of the world itself, an experience peculiar to *Dasein*.
Heidegger resisted Husserl's latent tendency toward abstraction and sought to ground his reflections in an analysis of everyday behavior.
Luhmann went the opposite way, i.e., towards an abstract theory.
However, both philosophers (Husserl and Heidegger) viewed the limits of knowledge and meaning through the lens of practical experience, that is, through living and being in the world.

Heidegger interprets in *Being and Time* {cite}`heidegger:1927` the world not as a collection of things or entities, as Cartesian metaphysicians would have it, but as a phenomenon imbued with pre-reflective meaning and understanding.
The objective world---the world of objects---is in fact derivative: it abstracts from a world of practical, absorbed engagement.
World is never an object that stands before us and can be seen.
The world as a world is always essentially doing something---it is in progress.
It orients, situates , guides and directs our lives in particular ways.
The temple established an epochal understanding of Being on the basis of which the Greeks meaningfully understood the beings they encountered and the event in their lives, thereby, giving them as a people a history or a destiny.
World is best associated with unconcealment, the clearing and intelligibility.
But bringing a new world into being will conceal another one.
So, in Heidegger's idea of art, the artist captures a snapshot of a *world* at any given moment. 
Once the work is removed from the context in which it was created, it can expose and recreate that past (or future) world for those who view it.

In contrast, *earth* (*Heimat*) is the homeland, in which the temple stands, but also the rock upon which the temple stands, and the temple stones themselves.
It is best described in terms of concealment, hiddenness and unintelligibility---it is similar to Lacan's concept of the *real* which evades all symbolic representation while pushing back against it.
The *real* is located beyond language and conceptual understanding, yet, always present in some sense.
The *real* is something you find always at the same place.
However you mess about, it is always in the same place, you bring it with you, stuck to the sole of your shoe without any means of exiling it.
*Earth*, like the *real* resists our attempts to assimilate it into our *world*.
The relation of world and earth is like a contestation between light and darkness but they are essential to each other.
And it is in *strife* that world and earth raise each other into the self-assertion of their essential natures.

Heidegger draws an important distinction between equipment (hammer, phones, keyboards, nails, etc.) and the work of art.
While the material of equipment withdraws out of notice, the opposite is the case for the work of art.

>In fabricating equipment---e.g., an ax---stone is used, and used up. It disappears into usefulness. The material is all the better and more suitable the less it resists vanishing in the equipmental being of the equipment. By contrast the temple-work, in setting up a world, does not cause the material to disappear, but rather causes it to come forth for the very first time and to come into the open region of the work’s world. The rock comes to bear and rest and so first becomes rock; metals come to glitter and shimmer, colors to glow, tones to sing, the word to say. All this comes forth as the work sets itself back into the massiveness and heaviness of stone, into the firmness and pliancy of wood, into the hardness and luster of metal, into the brightening and darkening of color, into the clang of tone, and into the naming power of word. -- Martin Heidegger

In the work of art, earthly elements (stones, woods, oil, etc.) are consecrated and transfigured into something radiant and mysterious which the human intellect cannot make completely comprehensible and assimilable.
If we think of a work of art phenomenologically, this seems to be true.
When looking at a great work of art the meaning of it oftentimes alludes us; we find ourselves wrestling with the work in order to make it fully intelligible, which never actually happens.
*Earth* as something, which makes up everything around us and gives our reality a context for us to sort our place in the world, by gaining reference from its physicality.
However, we can never see this *earth* for what it is, except in the special instance of when it is presented in an artwork.

>Standing there, the building rests on the rocky ground.
>This resting of the work draws up out of the rock the mystery of that rock's clumsy yet spontaneous support.
>Standing there, the building holds its ground against the storm raging above it and so first makes the storm itself manifest in its violence. 
>The luster and gleam of the stone, though itself apparently glowing only by the grace of the sun, yet first brings to light the light of the day, the breath of the sky, the darkness of the night.
>The temple's firm towering makes visible the invisible space of air [...] The Greeks early called this emerging and rising in itself and in all things phusis.
>It clears and illuminates, also, that on which and in which man bases his dwelling.
>We call this ground the earth. -- Martin Heidegger

So, because we see the temple as an art-thing, and also experience the *world* it creates, this highlights to us that it is made from something.
The rocks that may have been concealed from our attention before, because they used to be mixed in with nature, are now something else all together.
They are at one with the temple, but still we know they are rocks.
They shine out at us.
Their true nature is revealed in the tension between the rocks trying to be a temple but remaining rooted as *earth*.
Again, this is similar to Luhmann's claim that the *form* (the temple) reveals the *medium* (earth).

The world is usually invisible or transparent to us in our everyday activities.
It becomes visible through the opacity of earth in an artwork.
In a great work of art there’s always a *strife* between transparent intelligibility (*world*) and opaque unintelligibility (*earth*).
In that sense, earth is like the breakdown of equipment: The equipment withdraws from us (*ready-to-hand*) but it introduces itself as *present-at-hand* if it breaks or is missing.
But, unlike a breakdown of a tool, earth is unfixable.
Furthermore, it is only through the transparency of the world that earth can strike us as unintelligible, perplexing and mysterious.
The happening of truth in the work of art and the Being of the work of art is essentially the instigation of the *strife* between world and earth.
A great work of art intensifies this *strife* while establishing it.

That is why Heidegger, claims that artworks are more "thingly" than tools.
They do not withdraw but stay *present-at-hand* for *Dasein* because they are unfixable. 
Art can be thought of in terms of *Being*, *truth*, *world*, *earth* and *strife* and, according to Heidegger, the two essential features of great artwork are setting up of a world and setting forth of *earth*.
Furthermore, an epochal understanding of *Being* and a particular world are opened and held opened in *Dasein's* clearing by a specific being, i.e., a work of art.

We haven't really touched on the aesthetics of art; its beauty and ugliness or subjective quality.
I think, for Heidegger, it is more about truth than beauty.
Truth and art are deeply interconnected---not mutually exclusive.
But, of course, I am not talking about the truth as correspondence or agreement (adaequatio) but *truth as unconcealment* or uncovering.
Like the objective world is based on *Lebenswelt*, for Heidegger, the former is based on the latter.

With respect to music, Heidegger is rather silent.
He was convinced that music is essentially the art of feeling and not the art of tonally moving forms.
We do not find a philosophy of music in Heidegger’s work.
In fact, it could be argued that Heidegger’s attitude towards music is antagonistic.
He attacks the emotionality of music.
For example, about Wagner he says that his project was not just the predominance of music with respect to the other arts in his work that made him fail, but the problem inherent in aesthetics itself; namely, the reason why music was allowed to aspire to such a position.
Aesthetics is only a part of a greater movement in history---that of nihilism.

However, I believe there is more to music than Heidegger recognized. 
His perspective might have been too focused on the particular music of his era.
When the listener is absorbed by music, clock time is put out of play by the musical temporality: the musical time is the listener’s time.
In a performance the passing of time is not experienced individually.
The entire audience shares the temporality of the work, just as the musicians do (inter-subjective temporality).
We say that music moves us, i.e. the movement of the mind have been those of the musical movements which require space.
The temporality, mobility, and spatiality of music depend upon the tone. 
The tone is the *earth* of music.
In the musical work, the materiality is brought forth in the world with its temporality, mobility, and spatiality. 

Composers can change the conception of what was possible in music.
In a certain sense, their worlds changed the world that has become our world. 
In the absence of the exact words to describe the new world, it is perceived in its strangeness.
This is how truth is established in the workings of the artwork.
