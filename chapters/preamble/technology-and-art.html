<p>Marshall McLuhan the “high priest of popcult and metaphysician of media” of the 1960-ths famously stated that the media is the message.
McLuhan combined philosophy with literature, pop culture and media analysis.
Instead of focussing of the content of communication, he argued that the type of communication be it the internet, the radio or the TV, i.e., the technology itself is what really matters.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The message of TV is quite independent of the program.
The effect of the program is incidental. – Marshall McLuhan</p>

<p>In this section, I try to explain his thesis that technology shapes humans in a new way.
But I want to extend beyond questioning how various technologies shape and reshape our lives, and instead explore whether and how technology, as a mode of existence, also sets the horizon of our imagination.</p>
<section id="spaces-of-im-possibilities">
<h2>Spaces of (Im)Possibilities<a class="headerlink" href="#spaces-of-im-possibilities" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>The prevailing zeitgeist today is technological.
By this, I mean that while contemporary societies may critique the specific applications of technology, they rarely question its essence.
The assumption is that humans maintain control over technology and can therefore determine whether it is used for beneficial or harmful purposes.
Technology is often viewed as having both positive and negative effects, with its impact largely dependent on who controls it.
Many people see technology as a <em>mere tool</em>, adhering to the notion that guns don’t kill people, but people do.
For instance, the <em>European Commission</em> states in their white paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Like any technology, AI brings opportunities and risks. – <span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="../misc/bibliography.html#id30" title="European Commission. On Artificial Intelligence - a European approach to excellence and trust. Technical Report, European Commission, 02 2020. URL: https://commission.europa.eu/system/files/2020-02/commission-white-paper-artificial-intelligence-feb2020_en.pdf.">Com20</a>]</span></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This quote presumes that humans have full control over technology.
Janina Loh refers to this view as the <em>Neutrality Thesis of Technology</em> <span id="id2">[<a class="reference internal" href="../misc/bibliography.html#id31" title="Janina Loh. Roboterethik: Eine Einführung. Suhrkamp, 2019. ISBN 9783518298770. doi:10.1515/9783110659948.">Loh19</a>]</span>.
We view technology as something distinct from us, something we can command and control precisely.
This view is inherently <em>modern</em>;
The modern project is partly the emancipation of humanity from the hars environment determined by nature through science and technology.
In other words, technology is the means to an end that is the our emancipation from nature.</p>
<p>This view requires a clear distinction between the <em>subject</em> and the <em>object</em> where the <em>object</em> is by definition, non-human.
The <em>object</em> can be harnessed for good or evil, for the ugly or the beautiful, and it’s our prerogative to dictate its usage.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>[…] there is an idea that technology is in its essence something human beings have under their control. In my opinion, that is not possible. Technology is in its essence something that human beings cannot master of their own accord. – Heidegger</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The distinct subject-object differentiation might form a rational foundation for a worldview, enabling one to navigate through life ordinarily.
Via Kant and other thinkers of the <em>Enlightenment</em>, it led to a libertarian Western society that, in theory, safeguards an individual’s right to a fulfilling life.
However, the model of a society as merely the sum of all individuals no longer encapsulates its complexity and dynamics due to overwhelming evidence.
The same applies to technology.
The dynamic relationship is far more intricate than the simple notion of a group of subjects agreeing on and controlling the use of technology.</p>
<p>This viewpoint is especially challenged by <em>postmodern</em> and <em>posthuman</em> views on technology and with the advancements in <em>artificial intelligence</em>, especially in the field of <em>machine learning</em>, the question about our place within a technological society looms large.
While machines compute and humans think, machines are now able to participate in communication <span id="id3">[<a class="reference internal" href="../misc/bibliography.html#id27" title="Elena Esposito. Artificial Communication. The MIT Press, 2022. ISBN 9780262046664.">Esp22</a>]</span>.
And since, according to Niklas Luhmann, society is, in fact, all of the communication that is happening, <em>artificial communication</em> is now part of society.
I think it is reasonable to construct a theory where bodies, minds, technology, and other systems are deeply interconnected.</p>
<p>Let’s explore some examples of the impact of technological advancements.
In the 1920s, architect Robert Moses designed overpasses in New York that were too low for buses to pass beneath.
As buses primarily served low-income people of color, this design choice restricted their access to areas that white residents wanted to keep segregated.
Architecture is a form of regulation and control.
If a building has no entrance for wheelchairs, its design denies access for certain people;
By definition this is a form of discrimination—one that our society no longer “likes” since there is no more justification.
Not all forms of discriminations are seen as unjustfied today.
For example, the missing voting right for children is a form of discrimination that we accept.</p>
<p>Another prime illustration of this principle can be seen in digital spaces.
These environments are imbued with values, determined by the control and regulation of permissible actions.
Digital spaces, or <em>cyberspace</em>, as it’s often termed, have never been free from regulation, despite common misconceptions.
Rather than being shaped by traditional architectural forms, digital spaces are regulated by <em>source code</em>.
The design of websites or applications, dictated by this code, significantly influences the behavior of their users.
In other words, the very structure of these platforms functions as a form of regulation, guiding user interactions and activities.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Codes constitute cyberspaces; spaces enable and disable individuals and groups. The selections about code are therefore in part a selection about who, what, and, most important, what ways of life will be enabled and disabled. – <span id="id4">[<a class="reference internal" href="../misc/bibliography.html#id19" title="Lawrence Lessig. Code: Version 2.0. Basic Books, 2006. ISBN 9780465039142.">Les06</a>]</span></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Web pioneers often look back at the “good old days”.
Their (mine included) romantic view of the beginnings of the internet is that everything was possible.
It was easy to build a website.
A little bit of HTML, which you could hack into a simple text editor, and you are done.
However, without regulations coming from companies or institutions, social norms and code regulated the web instead.
And since information technolgy was rather new, a few individual coders had a lot to “say”.
Today, these individuals got replaced by a view companies.</p>
<p>Similar to Lessig, Don Ihde discusses in <em>Technology and the Lifeworld</em>, technology as an expandasion or limit of possibilities.
Technology goes beyond mere functionality or direct control.
<span id="id5">[<a class="reference internal" href="../misc/bibliography.html#id18" title="Sebastian Rosengrün. Why ai is a threat to the rule of law. Digital Society, 2022. doi:10.1007/s44206-022-00011-5.">Rosengrun22</a>]</span> argues that Western societies are currenty shifting from <em>Rule of Law</em> to <em>Rule of Code</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>[…] source code is about to become the main regulator of individual and institutional behavior that regulates all other regulators including law – <span id="id6">[<a class="reference internal" href="../misc/bibliography.html#id18" title="Sebastian Rosengrün. Why ai is a threat to the rule of law. Digital Society, 2022. doi:10.1007/s44206-022-00011-5.">Rosengrun22</a>]</span></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Rosengrün’s argument is not centered on the premise that regulation is inherently detrimental, or that large companies harbor malicious intentions.
Instead, he acknowledges the necessity, and indeed the inevitability, of regulation.
Moreover, he observes that the alignment of corporate regulatory practices with their profit-making objectives is to be expected.
He forcefully advocates for the <em>Rule of Law</em> as an indispensable prerequisite for a democratic society.
Consequently, any attempt to replace it, could precipitate the dissolution of such a society.
For this reason, Rosengrün asserts that code must be not only open but also subject to regulation.
He underscores the potential dangers of allowing code to regulate law.
For instance, when machine learning is used in the policy-making process, it is unrealistic to expect that law will maintain supremacy over code.</p>
<p>Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, recently proposed a licensing-based regulation during a US Senate hearing.
This proposal is concerning as it would potentially undermine the open-source community, achieving exactly the opposite of the intended effect.
While licensing could introduce some safety measures, ultimately it would protect large corporations and obscure the inner workings of the technology that regulate regulations.</p>
<p>The notion of <em>regulation by code</em> is familiar to us programmers, as we understand that even the selection of a programming language can either expand or limit our possibilities.
For instance, if one’s objective is to engage in machine learning, the programming language Scheme wouldn’t be the optimal choice.
Furthermore, the popularity of specific languages can influence their usage.
It’s important to note, however, that this degree of openness isn’t solely controlled by a single programmer.
Instead, it’s shaped by the broader social and technological systems that surround us.
As a significant amount of control lies with large corporations, they inherently influence the horizon of the possible.</p>
<p>Technology not only provides a framework for action, but also actively shapes our environment.
It constructs particular subjects and defines our identities, delineating not only who we are but also who we can potentially become.</p>
<p>Another stark illustration of technology’s pervasive (positive) influence can be found in modern birth control methods and in the strategies we deploy to shape our identities, such as curating online profiles to garner peer validation.
It’s widely acknowledged that social media can inadvertently amplify negative aspects of human behavior, underscoring the necessity to incorporate media into our understanding of this phenomenon.
Further instances of technology’s impact manifest in the realm of beauty and medical advancements.
Technologies related to beauty and cosmetic surgery exert pressure to conform to evolving standards of beauty, standards that were unattainable just six decades ago.
Similarly, assistive tools have profoundly enhanced the agency of individuals with disabilities, and advancements in medical transitions have carved out new avenues for expressing and experiencing transgender identities.</p>

<section id="heidegger-and-the-nazis">
<h2>Heidegger and the Nazis<a class="headerlink" href="#heidegger-and-the-nazis" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>In the following I want to talk about my interpretation of Martin Heidegger’s understanding of technology.
But before we can talk about that I have to include an important disclaimer!</p>
<p>While discussing the philosophical contributions of Heidegger, it is essential to also acknowledge his association with <em>National Socialism</em>.
He actively endorsed this ideology and exploited it as a mechanism for acquiring control, influence, and power.
For instance, he employed the services of the Gestapo (the Geheime Staatspolizei) to sideline his colleagues.
In other instances, he helped students to move away from the danger.
Regrettably, Heidegger neither apologized nor distanced himself from his actions, nor did he acknowledge any wrongdoing.
Instead, he attempted to obfuscate and justify his actions, which is particularly disconcerting given the fact that both his mentor, Edmund Husserl, and his student (and romantic partner), Hannah Arendt, were of Jewish descent.</p>
<p>Moreover, many argue that it is impossible to separate Heidegger’s politics from his philosophy—they are intertwined, and I tend to agree, at least to some extent.
Thus, engaging with Heidegger’s work can be a perilous undertaking, even if many of his ideas are incompatible with Nazism.
Perhaps it was his concern with technology that spiraled into fear and desperation, leading him to view Nazism as a means to escape the prevailing technological mode of being in his time.</p>
<p>Karl Popper, who coined the term <em>critical rationalism</em>, which is the bases for how we do science, has no good word for Heidegger.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Heidegger is, so to speak, the Hegelian of our time, who was also a Nazi, among other things. The worst part is that in Germany and all over the world, for example in South America, France, and Spain, Heidegger is admired and imitated. […] He usually writes things that one cannot understand at all, and that too, for pages on end! – Karl Popper</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Other notable critics include Karl Jaspers, Theodor W. Adorno (Frankfurt School), Jürgen Habermas (Frankfurt School), Kurt Tucholsky, and numerous others.
Heidegger’s thinking and writing have been criticized for dressing up banalities as profound insights, projecting his personal moods onto others, hiding behind an overly complex language, overemphasizing the role of human beings in dertermining the nature of being, lacking any ethical content, circular reasoning and tautologies, being the root for the rise of <em>relativism</em> and the rejection of objective turths.</p>
<p>Despite these criticisms, Heidegger remains an influential figure in the history of philosophy, and his ideas continue to be debated and studied in academic circles.
He influenced the works of Herbert Marcuse, Jean-Paul Sartre, Jacques Derrida, Paul Tillich, Michel Foucault and many more.
It would be a mistake to completely dismiss his works because of his character.
But it would also be a mistake to dive into his work without knowing about his actions and connections to the Nazi party.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>How is it that such a brilliant mind was taken in by the Nazis? How could Heidegger be so socially irresponsible? It is the same problem as with Celan: here is a wonderful writer who was a rotten anti-Semite […] I have shown Heidegger’s brain with a mushroom-like tumor growing out of it to make the point. – Anselm Kiefer</p>
</div></blockquote>
</section>
<section id="the-essence-of-technology">
<h2>The Essence of Technology<a class="headerlink" href="#the-essence-of-technology" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Heidegger goes a hell lot further.
In <em>Being and Time</em> (1927) <span id="id7">[<a class="reference internal" href="../misc/bibliography.html#id29" title="Martin Heidegger. Being and Time. Harper Perennial Modern Classics, 2008. ISBN 9780061575594.">Hei08</a>]</span> Heidegger argues <em>phenomenologically</em> that theoretical activities such as the natural sciences depend on views of time and space that narrow the understanding implicit in how we deal with the ordinary world of action and concern.
We cannot construct meaningful distance and direction, or understand the opportunities for action, from science’s neutral and mathematical understanding of space and time.
Indeed, this detached and supposedly <em>objective</em> scientific view of the world restricts our everyday understanding.
Our ordinary use of things and our <em>concernful dealings</em> within the world are pathways to a more fundamental and more truthful understanding of man and being than the sciences provide;
science flattens the richness of ordinary concern.</p>
<p>In his essay <em>The Question Concerning Technology</em> <span id="id8">[<a class="reference internal" href="../misc/bibliography.html#id32" title="Martin Heidegger. Die frage nach der technik. 1954.">Hei54</a>]</span>, Heidegger challenges the prevailing views of technology as merely an instrument (a means to an end) and as a product of human activity.
He posits that while we perceive ourselves as creators of technology, in reality, technology originates from elsewhere.
Perceiving certain types of technology as instruments or tools is itself a technological <em>mode of understanding</em>.
Heidegger argues that there is no such thing as a purely instrumental object.
Instruments only manifest to those who interpret the world instrumentally.
In this view, technology is a way of comprehending the world that reduces it to raw material, encouraging us to see the world solely as a realm for our intervention.</p>
<p>To find a pre-scientific view on the matter he goes back to ancient times.
In his view, the Greeks used the term <em>techne</em> to denote what we now call technology.
However, their concept of <em>techne</em> embraced both art and technique, something akin to our modern notion of <em>craft</em>.
For the Greeks, <em>techne</em> implied the act of bringing something into existence.
It was not about an engineer constructing an object; rather, the craftsman’s role was to assist in the emergence of something, so to say helping the material to take on a new form.
A craftsman would never consider themselves as the absolute origin of the reality of what they were creating.
In Heidegger’s view, they would perceive themselves as facilitating the process of something coming into existence.</p>
<p>In stark contrast, modern technology is not seen as aiding something to emerge.
Instead, as Heidegger posits, it forces things into existence.
We have come to perceive ourselves as the source of what we create, believing that we are the origin of everything.
This is a highly specific way of interpreting the world, one that seemingly grants us the power to control everything around us.
Therefore, technology unveils the world in a particular way—it reveals the world as raw material and conceals <em>Being</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>essence of technology</em> (das <em>Gestell</em>) is in its manner of <em>revealing</em> and <em>concealing</em>.
It is a way in which we encounter entities generally, including nature, ourselves, and, indeed, everything.
This implies that technological entities have their distinct form of presence, persistence, and relationships between parts and wholes.
They have their unique ways of presenting themselves and the world in which they exist—technology is about dominance and control.
However, the heart of the issue lies not in any specific machine, process, or resource.
Instead, technology is <em>challenging</em> (<em>herausfordernd</em>): the way the <em>essence of technology</em> shapes our understanding of all things, and the existence of those things themselves—the all-encompassing manner in which we encounter and are encountered by the technological world.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>[Because of technology] all distances in time and space are shrinking [and] yet the hasty setting aside of all distances brings no nearness; for nearness does not consist in a small amount of distance. – Martin Heidegger</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>We seem to have become nearly incapable of experiencing this nearness, let alone comprehending it, as all things increasingly manifest to us in a technological fashion: we perceive and interact with them as what Heidegger describes as a <em>standing reserve</em>, akin to supplies in a storeroom, items of inventory awaiting direction and mobilization, assembly and disassembly, positioning and dismissal.
Everything presents itself merely as an energy source or as a subject for our orchestration.
We even perceive human abilities as if they were merely instruments for technological procedures, as when a laborer becomes nothing more than a tool for production.
Leaders, planners, along with the rest of us, are mere human assets to be managed, reorganized, and discarded.
Every single entity that manifests itself technologically thereby forfeits its unique autonomy and form. We dismiss, conceal, or simply fail to perceive, other potentialities.</p>
<p>The mode of revealing that prevails in modern technology does not manifest as a bringing forth in the sense of <em>poiesis</em> (<em>Gestalt</em>).
Instead, the revealing that governs modern technology is a <em>challenging</em> (<em>Herausfordern</em>) one, which places an unreasonable demand on nature to provide energy that can be extracted and stored.
It’s important to note that, for Heidegger, the <em>challenge</em> precedes the unlocking, thus the <em>essence of technology</em> predates natural science.
It was technological thinking that first understood nature in such a way that nature could be challenged to unlock its forces and energy.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Modern technology is not applied natural science, far more is modern natural science the application of the essence of technology. [Nature is therefore] the fundamental piece of inventory of the technological standing reserve—and nothing else. – Martin Heidegger</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The nature of <em>being-in-the-world</em> (Dasein) is such that we can never escape concerns about our dealings (<em>Sorge</em>) which orginates from our finitude, but we frequently attempt to deny them.
We distract ourselves from our worries, the primary of which is death, and consequently live inauthentically.
Our relationship with technological tools, techniques, and devices can aid this distraction, diverting us from our fundamental experience and enticing us into a false sense of security.
This can be dangerous if it impedes the lived awareness of our ultimate existence</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>as beings in trouble in a world of uncertainty.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>We become accustomed to the internet, smartphones, social media, platform economies, and the endless repetition of trivialities.
As individuals, we can often feel powerless in the face of new technologies, and occasionally experience a lack of depth provided by the scattered and dissected elements of our existence.
The <em>essence of technology</em> deprives us of experiencing nearness because to truly experience it, we must encounter things in their truth.
And no matter how deeply we believe that science will allow us to engage with reality in its actuality, science only provides us with representations of things.
It only ever encounters that which its manner of representation has previously admitted as a possible object for itself.</p>
<p>Today the representational character of the digital shapes the physical.
Speaking in Baudrillardian terms: through the colonization of the last frontier—our immediate consciousness—companies are constructing a virtual yet <em>hyper-realistic world</em> that suggests that there is no truth behind it.
This process is evolving so rapidly that meaningful analysis becomes impossible.
Our children will navigate a “meta”-reality.
They won’t believe that the world depicted on their screens and other devices is real—that is not the danger!
I also doubt that they will consciously believe the fake stories of this realm saturated by advertisement.
Instead, they run the risk of becoming cynical; of perceiving the real world as virtual.
Threfore, they may consider everything as a scene to be observed, and all their actions as performances that can be captured and reviewed at any given moment.
This would deny them a live of moments and turn it into a plan for later presentations.
Kids sense the digital world in a peculiar, allusive, and meta-like state.
This is why their memes are perpetually ironic, detached, self-referential, and buried beneath twenty layers of irony; the truth is completely dead to them.
They look at a <em>postmodern</em> president and culture and ask: what on earth is this?
They see Coca Cola advertisements that are knowingly winking and smiling at them, and they see through this nonsense.</p>
<p>Going back to the <em>challenging</em> essence of technology, it implies that functioning things lead to more functioning things.
Everything is <em>challenged</em> to serve as a systematic resource for technological application, which we subsequently utilize as a resource for further application, perpetuating a cycle.
For instance, we <em>challenge</em> land to produce coal, considering the land as nothing more than a coal deposit.
The coal is then stockpiled, always ready to unleash the stored solar heat it contains, which is then called upon for warmth, which subsequently is commanded to yield steam whose pressure drives the wheels that sustain a factory’s operations.
The factories themselves are <em>challenged</em> to create tools through which machines are once again put into service and preserved.
Heidegger argues that this chain does not move toward anything that has its own presence, but, instead, “only enters into its <em>circuit</em>”, and is “regulating and securing” natural resources and energies in this never-ending fashion.
No one asked for the Metaverse, but we will built it anyways because we are <em>challenged</em> to do so.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A success is that type of consequence that itself remains assigned to the yielding of further consequences. – Martin Heidegger</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>As already mentioned, Heidegger thinks of technology as a <em>mode of seeing</em> where every “seeing” has its necessary blind spots.
He expands on the example of the hammer to illustrate his thoughts about technology:
when using a hammer (a form of technology), you don’t even think about the tool itself; instead, you focus on the nail.
The hammer recedes from your awareness, and you concentrate on the task <em>at hand</em>.</p>
<p>Or imagine a more modern example, for instance, the keyboard.
As you become proficient at typing, your primary experience involves the words appearing on the screen rather than the act of pressing the keys.
Furthermore, if you recognize a keyboard you not only see the thing as it appears to you but you also “see” all the possibilites that the thing opens up for you.
The keyboard is, so to say, not only an object but an offer to explore and interact with the world in a certain way.
This phenomenological way of thinking about objects as they appear to us was already formulated by Edmund Husserl who was Heidegger’s teacher.</p>

<div><p>This world is not there for me as mere world of facts and affairs, but, with the same immediacy as a world of values, a world of goods, a practical world. Without further effort on my part I find the things before me furnished not only with the qualities that benefit their positive nature, but with value-characters such as beautiful or ugly, agreeable or disagreeable, pleasant or unpleasant, and so forth. Things in their immediacy stand there as objects to be used, the “table” with its “books”, the “glass to drink from”, the “vase”, the “piano” and so forth […] The same considerations apply of course just as well to the men and beasts in my surroundings as to “mere things”. They are my “friends” or my “foes”, my “servants” or “superios”, “strangers” or “relatives” and so forth. – Edmund Husserl</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Technology vanishes from our <em>world</em>.
Only if it breaks or fails to perform as expected it introduces itself again.
Otherwise, it simply serves as a medium through which we experience our world.
For Heidegger, technology withdraws from our attention and becomes transparent.
We don’t experience the technology itself, but rather the world through it.
Consequently, technology introduces its own <em>mode of seeing</em>.</p>
<p>When you drive a car proficiently, you develop a sense of the vehicle’s size and whether it can fit through a gap.
Similarly, wearing nail extensions frequently can cause you to forget about them, even though they change how you interact with objects.
Part of the allure of technology is found in the diverse opportunities it provides for unique forms of embodiment.
Philosopher Bruno Latour posits that when technology becomes sufficiently transparent, it becomes an intrinsic part of our self-perception and our experience of the world, thereby giving rise to a new, compound entity.
Evidence from cognitive science supporting this viewpoint is substantial.
Our enjoyment of driving stems from the fact that we transform into “the driver”, a being with speed and power surpassing any land creature.
Likewise, our delight in operating digital devices arises from the sensation of becoming a being that can converse with someone on the opposite side of the globe at a speed comparable to a lightning strike.</p>
<p>Similarly, a person wielding a hammer essentially evolves into a new subject, equipped with its own unique way of perceiving the world.
This newly formed subject, as a result of the technology’s influence, experiences the world from a distinct perspective and possesses an individualized subjectivity.</p>
<p>Given that technology represents a <em>mode of understanding</em> the world, and acknowledging that our understanding of the world is not entirely self-determined, this perspective seems to envelop us; it is greater than us as individuals.
Heidegger sees the <em>highest danger</em> of technology as its potential to erode our ability to interpret reality profoundly.</p>
<p>The moment we start viewing ourselves as manipulable raw materials, we cease to see ourselves as the ultimate source from which fresh interpretations of the world can spring.
Furthermore, technology can trap us in a specific worldview because as soon as we attempt to devise a new way of interpreting the world, we find ourselves trying to exert power over our inherent <em>will to power</em>.
In essence, we attempt to control our very propensity for control.
Every effort to overcome this <em>will to power</em> only serves to reinforce it.
Consequently, every attempt to break free from this technological mindset only propels us back into it.</p>

<h2>The Need to Differentiate<a class="headerlink" href="#the-need-to-differentiate" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Heidegger’s arguments about technology also raise several difficulties.
Indeed, one might inquire (despite Heidegger’s objection to such questioning) about the origins of technology in its essence.
Is the manner in which beings reveal themselves to us meaningful only in Heidegger’s terms, or can a rationale be provided for this meaning that simultaneously permits and even requires moral decision-making and openness to being beyond Heidegger’s limits?
Given that phenomena appear to us technologically in a manner seemingly tied to choices we make based on specific conceptions of happiness, the good, and the sacred (all of which are, to some degree, subject to rational debate), isn’t it valid that all things technological can be judged, questioned, assessed, and ranked?
Is our comprehension of happiness, the good, and the sacred truly subservient to a preliminary understanding of entities as technological, or is it intertwined and contemporaneous with it, or even preceding it?</p>
<p>I am not advocating for either denial or embracement of technology in general.
I love technology, and indeed, I would probably be dead without it.
For most of us, rejecting technology is no longer an option.
However, I believe that we can cultivate a reflexive understanding that enables us to recognize how reality is constructed by our increasingly technological worldview.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It certainly is not a matter of condemning the industrial and technological fate of humanity. Rather, it is a case of reinventing this fate. – Bernard Stiegler</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In addition to the crucial distinction between <em>mere technology</em> and the <em>essence of technology</em>, we must also examine material realities.
Who controls the production of mere technology and to what end?
I believe that digital technology is potent and could support us to solve many of humanity’s problems, from climate change to income distribution, sensor-based agricultural practices, food, education, and the eradication of racialization, gender discrimination, ableism, and classism.
Digital technology can be incredible, but when decisions about its development, deployment, and use are exclusively in the hands of businesspeople, we encounter a problem.
These individuals implement a perilous form of a technology-driven society with the economy at its absolute center: a type of digital/computational capitalism where algorithms generate money rather than value.</p>
<p>Additionally, it may be worth considering Heidegger’s perspective on technology, which I am unable to elaborate fully upon here.
We are likely to encounter significant issues if we believe that technology alone will resolve all of today’s major challenges, while it undeniably contributes to many of them.
Moreover, the symbols of the struggle for a more equitable society have already been integrated into the very system that requires transformation.
The heated ecosystem of culture wars serves as a divisive instrument that erodes the public capacity to demand enduring material changes.</p>
<p>We are no longer operating in a free market.
Late-stage capitalism now features a new type of platform economy that resembles feudalism, where peasants work the land of the lords.
We’re in a situation where people don’t have equal access to tools and technology and no longer maintain control.
When a young person has an idea, they naturally approach a financier, perceiving it as the only way to get their product developed.
Developers and entrepreneurs often start with a genuine desire to improve the world.
They believe their contribution will benefit the world and empower not just them and their investors, but also some industry or consumer base.
However, accepting funding from problematic sources often forces them into specific actions.
Ultimately, on the stock market, business becomes gamified.
Companies shift their focus away from their products and become preoccupied with competition—Bezos versus Sergey Brin versus Mark Zuckerberg.</p>
<p>Additionally, since the digital industry is characterized by non-scarcity, it had to introduce a new business logic that gathers, concentrates, and protects knowledge and information.
Under the guise of improving customer services, this new business logic aims to provide consumers with exactly what they want.
I would argue, however, that the goal is more about manipulating consumers into an endless cycle of mostly subpar consumer goods.
Desire is produced, channeled, and confused.</p>
<p>We have to ask:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Are we programmers, or are we programmed?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The customer of <em>Meta</em> is not the young girl using it to forge friendships.
Rather, it’s the company purchasing the girl’s <em>social graph</em>.
Who is <em>Uber</em>’s customer? It isn’t the driver, though it should be.
Nor is it the passenger, even though it could be.
Instead, it’s the shareholder, the investor.
<em>Uber</em> isn’t concerned about creating a robust, sustainable taxi industry.</p>
<p>We must critically analyze the implications of each technology, which means we must abandon the neutral point of view.
However, I’m not advocating for a return to some mythical naturalistic past, some elusive authenticity.
This would only lead to disillusionment because such authenticity was never present to begin with.
Nature is a splendid beast; it is <em>the real</em> that pursues us.
The notion of returning to nature—withdrawing from altering landscapes, bodies, and psychological systems—lacks basis from a naturalistic ontological perspective.
There’s no reason why we shouldn’t challenge its normative power, particularly when constructed power structures masquerade as natural!
But, heeding Heidegger, we must acknowledge that</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>dominating nature leads to the domination of humanity.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The <em>essence of technology</em> is inherently challenging and tends to lead to domination.
Moreover, specific technological tools are invariably based on certain values and intentions.
If we opt to utilize a particular technology, we must understand these underlying values and intentions.</p>
<p>Does this technology empower the right people?
Who is it emancipatory for? How does it alter our ways of thinking, feeling, and communicating?
Is it beneficial to us? Who is in control of it? What are its intended goals?
Does it truly function as anticipated? What new possibilities does it create?
Does it harbor artistic potential? What existing realities does it dismantle?
Moreover, and perhaps most crucially, can we perceive it as more than just a tool?
Can we appreciate it in its entirety—as it presents itself to us, without reducing it to its constituent parts, functions, and effects? I am a proponent of a culture of mindful engagement—a society of informed participants within the sphere of technology.
A capable society should possess the authority to reject technological progress in favor of cultural advancement.</p>
<p>We must understand how we can be manipulated, what is beneficial for us, and what our needs are.
For instance, we know that non-virtual social interactions are vital.
It’s soothing and comforting for human beings to make eye contact with others, thereby achieving physical synchronization with another person.
Today, much of our communication lacks this synchronization.
This communication is superficial and abstract, leaving us feeling hollow and increasingly fatigued.
However, approaching this issue from a scientific perspective, that is, socializing because we understand it’s beneficial for us, misinterprets the essence of the matter as we would be treating togetherness as a <em>mere tool</em>, i.e., technology!</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The 21st century is oppressed by a crushing sense of finitude and exhaustion. – Mark Fisher</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>We exist within a constant churn of emails, calendars, and Zoom meetings, often neglecting the things that truly bring us happiness: engaging in conversations with others, playing with our children, and expressing love.
Concurrently, there persists an ever-present <em>fear of missing out</em>: can I seize this opportunity before it’s entirely gone?
Analyzing <em>mere technology</em> through an honest scientific lens is valuable, yet it doesn’t address the crux of Heidegger’s observations.
To comprehend the <em>essence of technology</em>, we might need to grapple with its and our timely <em>being in the world</em>.</p>
<p>What engenders a degree of optimism in me is the younger generation.
Despite the rising suicide rates, arguably linked to social media usage, I’ve noticed a trend of increased caution towards technology among some individuals.
Many young individuals in my vicinity seem to utilize technology more judiciously, primarily because they are less captivated by it.
They appear to comprehend that these massive tech companies are not invested in enhancing their lives, but rather in leveraging them as tools.</p>
<p>I am of the belief that technology is invariably both destructive and creative.
It disrupts existing spaces while simultaneously forging new ones.
Art, however, has the capacity to accentuate the open relationship between <em>earth</em> (rock and stone, flood and famine, birth and death, tools and technology) and the <em>world</em> (the cultural and historical horizon that both reveals and conceals the earth).
Art can, so to speak, unify them.
Unlike technology, artistic works offer numerous paths and are more open in their <em>revealing</em>.
An artwork opens up pathways, relationships, and possibilities.
Art can elucidate the meaning of technology, enabling us to develop an open relationship with it.
A piece of art can expose our uncertainty about whether technology can be disregarded, or whether it embodies a seductive cosmic force that we’re incapable of resisting.</p>

<section id="turning-away-from-danger">
<h2>Turning Away from Danger<a class="headerlink" href="#turning-away-from-danger" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>We are obliged to perpetually reflect on the <em>essence of technology</em> and its <em>danger</em>.
I believe it’s not a matter of outright resistance or unconditional acceptance, but rather of informed ambivalence, deliberate retreat, and vigilant anticipation.
It is attention to technology as a <em>mode of seeing</em> that will help us.
Other kinds of <em>revealing</em>, and attention to the realm of <em>truth</em> and <em>being</em> as such, will allow us to experience the technological within its own bounds.
Consequently, the artist’s duty is to disclose and explore this process <em>phenomenologically</em>.
She is the one who crafts aesthetic symbols, setting the stage for a possible future.
The approach should involve neither prejudice nor antagonism, but rather sincere engagement with technology and its creators.
After all, the artifacts of our past aren’t natural occurrences but are crafted by people.
Yet, what has transpired and what will occur are guided by the horizon of possibilities, which is <em>enframed</em> (gestellt) by technology and unveiled by artistic works.</p>
<p>Our thought process should acknowledge the <em>challenge</em> posed by technology.
We must enter the realm where things can show themselves to us truthfully in a manner not limited to the technological.
We must resist our automatic acceptance of the <em>challenge</em> and the current state of “progress”, as it tends to instill a sense of powerlessness towards instigating change.
There is neither room for bittersweet melancholy nor illusions that minor local changes will be adequate.</p>
<p>Echoing the words of Mark Fisher: I’m not apprehensive about a zombie apocalypse; rather, my concern lies in the ease with which people can envisage such an apocalypse, in contrast to visualizing life a decade or two hence.
My worry is that we may have already conceded defeat, that we lack the imagination and bravery to adopt different strategies, and that we might succumb to reflexive responses and seemingly easy but unrealistic solutions.</p>
<p>While many critics of technology highlight its apparent dangers, Heidegger underscores a different type of peril: the potential of technology to obstruct us from hearing “the call of a more primal truth”.
The issue is not solely that technology impedes our access to this sphere, but that it causes us to entirely forget the existence of this realm.
Nevertheless, Heidegger posits that by acknowledging this danger, we might be able to discern and then address what has been neglected.
The realization of our essence as receptive to this sphere, and of technology as merely one avenue through which things can manifest, is the roadmap for keeping technology within its appropriate confines.
The thought that unfolds the potential for a <em>turn</em> away from technology and towards its fundamental domain is the recognition of its hazard.
Ultimately, it may be the <em>energy of earth</em> that unveils a potential earth-world relationship.
This could be Heidegger’s god, for whom we are waiting and preparing for.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Philosophy will not be able to bring about a direct change of the present state of the world. This is true not only of philosophy but of all merely human meditations and endeavors. Only a god can still save us. I think the only possibility of salvation left to us is to prepare readiness, through thinking and poetry, for the appearance of the god or for the absence of the god during the decline; so that we do not, simply put, die meaningless deaths, but that when we decline, we decline in the face of the absent god. – Heidegger, Spiegel inverview in 1966</p>
