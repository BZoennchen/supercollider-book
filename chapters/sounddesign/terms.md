(sec-decibel)=
## Decibel

Decibel (dB) is a relative unit of measurement.
It is one-tenth of a bel: 1 dB equals 0.1 B.
It expresses the ratio of two values of a power or root-power quantity on a logarithmic scale using 10 as the base.

A sound's loudness is measured in decibels.
Since the measure is relative, we have to fix it if we want to use a decibel scale.
It is convenient to start with 

+ 0 dB as near-total silence.
+ a whisper is about 15 dB
+ a library 45 dB
+ a normal conversation 60 dB
+ a toilet flushing 75-85 dB
+ a noisy restaurant 90 dB
+ a baby crying 110 dB
+ a jet engine 120 dB
+ a ballon popping 157 dB

The measurement is motivated by the perception of loudness of the human ear.
Increasing the **perceived** loudness by a factor of 2 equates to rise of +3 dB.
In other words: every increase of 3 dB represents a doubling of sound intensity or acoustic power.

We can use db instead of amplitude (amp) to control the loudness in **sclang**.
To convert db to amp use ``dbamp`` and ``ampdb`` to do the reverse operation.

```isc
0.dbamp; // equals 1 amp 
1.dbamp; // 1.122018454302
(-3).dbamp; // 0.70794578438414
3.dbamp; // 1.4125375446228
```

For example, the sound generated by

```isc
{SinOsc.ar(400!2) * (-3).dbamp;}.play
```

should be approximately perceived half the level of  

```isc
{SinOsc.ar(400!2)}.play
```

(sec-lfo)=
## Low Frequency Oscillator

A low frequency oscillator (LFO) is, as its name suggests, an oscillator that oscillates with a low frequency, that is, a frequency that is below the audible frequency.
LFO's are often used to control some argument of another oscillator, for example, to control its amplitude.

(sec-rm)=
## Ring Modulation

Ring modulation (RM) is often used as a synonym for [amplitude modulation (AM)](sec-am).
