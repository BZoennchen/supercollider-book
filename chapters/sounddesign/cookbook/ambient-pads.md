# Ambient Pad

*Ambient sound* (or ambiance) is some sort of smooth background noise often present at a given scene or location.
This can include noises such as rain, wind, traffic, crickets, birds, running water, fan and motor noises, and so on.
Often we want to remove these background sounds from the signal.
But sometimes we want to add them artificially.

*Ambience* is the opposite of *silence*.
Every location has distinct and subtle sounds created by its environment.
Reverberation often further distorts the noise by introducing complex pattern of peaks and nulls in their [frequency spectrum](sec-freq-spectrum).
It blurrs their temporal characteristics.
High frequency vanish faster and the sound becomes doll.
