# # Filter Response
# 
# To characterize a filter we general want to know its
# 
# 1. **amplitude frequency response**, and its
# 2. **phase response**.
# 
# If a filter sharply sets the a specific range of frequencies to zero and let the rest untouched it is called *brick wall*.
# For example, we could compute the [Fourier transform](def-fourier-transform-exp) of a signal and then multiply frequency in that range with zero.
# For computational complexity and buffering reasons, such ideal filters are rahter unpractical for real-time use.
# 
# ```{admonition} Filtering and the Fourier transform
# :name: remark-filtering-and-convolution
# :class: remark
# 
# Filtering can be achieved by multiplication in the spectural domain and by convolution in the time domain.
# 
# ```
# 
# Therefore, most filters work differently.
# They reduce or strengthen the power of certain frequencies.
# 
# ## Butterworth Filter
# 
# If we speak of filters, we often refer to *low pass* or *high pass filters*. 
# They filter frequencies above or below some *cutoff frequency*.
# For example, the low pass filter ``LPF`` in ``sclang`` is a *2nd order Butterworth lowpass filter*.

# Effect of a first-order Butterworth lowpass filter. By Alejo2083 - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, [link](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=735081).
# ```
# 
# The filter reduces the gain (amplitude) for frequencies above the cutoff frequency and shifts their phases.
# Well, that is not entirely true because the cutoff frequency is also reduced by 6 [decibel (dB)](sec-intensity), so the reduction starts a little bit below the cutoff frequency.
# Reducing the loudness by 6 dB means that the perceived level is reduced by a factor of 4.
# The top plot of {numref}`Fig. {number} <fig-butterworth-filter>` shows the reduction in amplitude.
# 
# The second effect of the filter is a phase shift; compare the bottom plot of {numref}`Fig. {number} <fig-butterworth-filter>`.
# This effect is crucial if we combine multiple filters because they interact!
# In other words: we can not just combine a high pass and low pass filter to get the same result as a band pass filter!
# 
# The following code is an example of a band pass filter.
# First, we use a low pass and high pass filter; then a band pass filter.
# The results sound very similar but not identical.
# 
# ```isc
# ({
#     var sig = LFSaw.ar(500) ! 2 * 0.5;
#     sig = HPF.ar(sig, 200);
#     sig = LPF.ar(sig, 300);
#     sig
# }.play;)
# 
# ({
#     var sig = LFSaw.ar(500) ! 2 * 0.5;
#     var bandwidth = 100;
#     var cuttoffFeq = 200;
#     sig = BPF.ar(sig, 250, rq: bandwidth / cuttoffFeq);
#     sig
# }.play;)
# ```
# 
# For completeness I also want to mention the inverse filter of a band pass filter: the band reject filter ``BRF``.
# The following example rejects frequencies between 200 and 300 Hz, i.e., the inverse operation as before.
# 
# ```isc
# ({
#     var sig = LFSaw.ar(500) ! 2 * 0.5;
#     var bandwidth = 100;
#     var cuttoffFeq = 200;
#     sig = BRF.ar(sig, 250, rq: bandwidth / cuttoffFeq);
#     sig
# }.play;)
# ```
# 
# ## Computation (Example)
# 
# Let us define some relevant terms and formulas such that we can characterize filters.
# I will do so by example.
# The *gain* $H(f)$ in frequency $f$ is equal to the frequency amplitude of the input signal divided by the frequency amplitude of the output signal:
# 
# \begin{equation}
# G(f) = \frac{O(f)}{I(f)}
# \end{equation}
# 
# Let $x[n]$ be an input signal, $y[n]$ the output signal of the filter and $f_s = \frac{1}{T}$ the sample rate.
# Let use start with a very *simple filter*:
# 
# \begin{equation}
# y[n] = x[n] + x[n-1], \quad n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots
# \end{equation}
# 
# Note that $x[t]$ is defined for $t = n T$ with $n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$
# 
# To analyse what effect the filter has on a specific frequency we define $x[n]$ to be a sinusoid containing one specific frequency $f$.
# Therefore, we assume:
# 
# \begin{equation*}
# x[n] = A \cdot e^{i(2\pi f n T + \phi)}.
# \end{equation*}
# 
# Let us simplify by assuming $A = 1$, $\phi = 0$ and $\omega = 2\pi f$ thus
# 
# \begin{equation*}
# x[n] = e^{i \omega n T}.
# \end{equation*}
# 
# Therefore, $y[n]$ is defined by
# 
# \begin{equation*}
# \begin{split}
# y[n] &= e^{i \omega n T} + e^{i \omega (n-1) T}\\
# &= e^{i \omega n T} + e^{i \omega n T} \cdot e^{-i \omega n T}\\
# &= (1 + e^{-i \omega T}) \cdot e^{i \omega n T}\\
# &= (1 + e^{-i \omega T}) \cdot x[n]
# \end{split}
# \end{equation*}
# 
# Therefore, the *gain* for this filter is
# 
# $$G(\omega) = |(1 + e^{-i \omega T})|$$
# 
# and the phase response is
# 
# $$\mathcal{\Theta}(\omega) = \angle 1 + e^{-i \omega T}.$$
# 
# ```{admonition} Filter Response
# :name: def-filter-response
# :class: definition
# 
# The overall *filter response* can be represented in one formula (see section [Complex Numbers](sec-complex-numbers))
# 
# \begin{equation}
# H(\omega) = \underbrace{G(\omega)}_{\text{Amplitude}} \cdot \underbrace{e^{-i \mathcal{\Theta}(\omega)}}_{\text{Phase}}.
# \end{equation}
# 
# where $G(\omega)$ is the *amplutide frequency response* and $\mathcal{\Theta}(\omega)$ the *phase response* of the filter.
# 
# ```
# 
# We can further manipulate the formula for the *gain* by the following:
# 
# \begin{equation*}
# \begin{split}
# 1 + e^{-i \omega T} &= e^0 + e^{-i \omega T}\\
# &= (e^{i\omega T / 2} + e^{-i \omega T / 2}) \cdot e^{-i \omega T / 2}
# \end{split}
# \end{equation*}
# 
# using 
# 
# $$\cos(\phi) = \frac{e^{i\phi} - e^{-i \phi} }{2}$$
# 
# we get
# 
# \begin{equation*}
# \begin{split}
# 1 + e^{-i \omega T} &= 2 \cdot \cos(\omega T / 2) \cdot e^{-i \omega T / 2}
# \end{split}
# \end{equation*}
# 
# Thus
# 
# $$G(\omega) = |2 \cdot \cos(\omega T / 2) \cdot e^{-i \omega T / 2}| = 2|\cos(\omega T / 2)|.$$
# 
# Because of the [Nyquistâ€“Shannon sampling theorem](theorem-sampling), we can assume that we only look at frequencies $f$ such that $-f_s/2 \leq f \leq +f_s / 2$ holds.
# Therefore, the equation simplifies to
# 
# $$2\cos(\omega T / 2)$$
# 
# for $-\pi \leq \omega \leq \pi$.
# The following plot shows the amplitude frequency response in $\omega$.

# In[2]:


t = np.linspace(-np.pi, np.pi, 1000)
gain = lambda x: 2 * np.cos(x)

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,5))
ax.plot(t, gain(t), label=r'$y(t)$')
ax.set_xticks([-np.pi, 0, np.pi])
ax.set_xticklabels([r'$-\pi$', r'0', r'$+\pi$'])
ax.set_ylabel(r'Gain $G(\omega)$')
ax.set_xlabel(r'$\omega\,(=2\pi f)$');


# Secondly we look at the *phase response*
# 
# $$\mathcal{\Theta}(\omega) = -\frac{\omega T}{2}, \quad -\pi \leq \omega \leq \pi.$$
# 
# If we set $T = 1$ the plot looks like the following figure.

# In[3]:


t = np.linspace(0, np.pi, 1000)
phase = lambda x: -x/2

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,5))
ax.plot(t, phase(t), label=r'$y(t)$')
ax.set_xticks([0, np.pi/2, np.pi])
ax.set_yticks([-np.pi/2, -np.pi/4, 0])
ax.set_xticklabels([r'$0$', r'$\pi/2$', r'$\pi$']);
ax.set_yticklabels([r'$-\frac{\pi}{2}$', r'$-\frac{\pi}{4}$', r'$0$']);
ax.set_ylabel(r'Phase Shift $\mathcal{\Theta}(\omega)$')
ax.set_xlabel(r'$\omega$');


# This *low pass filter* has no phase delay at 0 Hz and a maximum delay of $-(\pi/2)T$ at the Nyquist frequency.
# Note that both responses rely on the sample rate $f_s = 1 / T$.
# Furthermore, the phase shift depends on $\omega$.
# It looks like this might lead to a phase distortion, however, this frequency-dependent delay is counteracted because doubling the frequency of the input halves its period, balancing the growth in retardation introduced by the filter.
# This linear dependence is actually necessary.
# 
# ```{admonition} Linear Phase Filters
# :name: def-linear-phase-filter
# :class: definition
# 
# If the phase response of the filter is a linear (straight-line) function of frequency (excluding phase wraps at $\pm 180$ degree), the filter is said to be *linear phase*.
# 
# ```
# 
# Filters that are not linear phase can introduce *phase distortion*.
