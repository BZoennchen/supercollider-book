# Up to this point, we considered continuous signals $y(t)$.
# In section [Fourier Series](sec-fourier), we started with **continuous periodic fuctions**.
# We generalized this concept to **continuous aperiodic fuctions** in section [Fourier Transform](sec-fourier-transform).
# That's all fine but on a computer we are not dealing with continuous functions.
# On a computer, audio is digitalized.
# That is, we are dealing with **discrete signals**.
# 
# ## Definitions
# 
# To deal with a **periodic** and **discrete** signal we switch from the *[Fourier transform](def-fourier-transform-exp)* to the *[discrete Fourier transform](def-discrete-fourier-transform)*.
# If we want to handle a **non-periodic** and **discrete** signal we apply the *discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT)* instead.
# For audio signals the DTFT is not that relevant.

# ````{admonition} Discrete Fourier Series (DFS)
# :name: def-fourier-series-exp-discrete
# :class: definition
# 
# The *discrete Foruier series* $y: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ in *exponential form* of a periodic and discrete function $y[n]$ is defined by
# 
# $$y[n] = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{N-1} c^*[k] \cdot e^{i\frac{2\pi}{N}kn}, \quad n \in \mathbb{Z},$$
# 
# which are harmonics of a fundamental frequency $1/N$, for some positive integer $N$ (the period of the signal).
# ````
# 
# This looks very similar to the [Fourier series](def-fourier-series-exp) except that $e^{ikn\frac{2\pi}{N}}$ is a discrete instead of a continuous function.
# Instead of a sum of continuous functions, the *[discrete Fourier Series](def-fourier-series-exp-discrete)* is a sum of discrete functions.
# Furthermore, there are only $N$ distinct coefficients $c^*[0], \ldots, c^*[N-1]$.
# $y[n]$ is periodic and so is $c^*[k]$.

# Similar to the *[Fourier transform](def-fourier-transform-exp)* there is an inverse transformation.

# ````{admonition} Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT)

# :class: definition
# 
# The *inverse discrete Fourier transform IDFT* transforms a sequence of $N$ *complex numbers* $c[0], \ldots, c[N-1]$ into another sequence of complex numbers  $y[0], \ldots, y[N-1]$, such that

# 
# Note that the *[inverse discrete Fourier transform  IDFT](def-inverse-discrete-fourier-transform)* is a specific examle of a *[discrete Fourier series](def-fourier-series-exp-discrete)*.
# 
# ## Example
# 
# Suppose the following signal is given
# 
# $$y(t) = \underbrace{5}_{\text{DC}} + \underbrace{2 \cos(2\pi t - \pi/2)}_{\text{1 Hz}} + \underbrace{3 \cdot \cos(4\pi t)}_{\text{2 Hz}}.$$
# 
# Let's sample $y(t)$ at 4 times per second, i.e. a *sample rate* $f_s$ of 4 Hz from $t = 0$ to $t=3/2$.
# The values of the discrete samples are given by:
# 
# $$y[n] = 5 + 2 \cos(\pi/3 n - \pi/2) + 3 \cos(\pi n)$$
# 
# for $t = n / 4$.
# We get $y[0] = 8$, $y[1] = 4$, $y[2] = 8$, $y[3] = 0$, $y[4] = y[0]$, ...
# Clearly $N = 4$ since we have frequencies of 1 and 2 Hz and a sample frequency $f_s$ of 4 Hz.

# In[2]:


y1 = lambda t: 2 * np.cos(2*np.pi*t - np.pi/2)
y2 = lambda t: 3 * np.cos(4*np.pi*t)
dc = lambda t: np.ones(len(t))*5
y = lambda t: dc(t) + y1(t) + y2(t)

t = np.linspace(0, 2, 1000)
n = np.linspace(0, 1, 5)[:-1]
y_n = y(n)

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,5))
ax.plot(t, y(t), label=r'$y(t)$')
ax.plot(t, y1(t), label=r'1 Hz', linestyle='--')
ax.plot(t, y2(t), label=r'2 Hz', linestyle='--')

# Let us implement the *DFT* and *IDFT* using ``Python``.
# The following code is inefficient but suffice for our purposes.
# 
# ### DFT

# In[3]:


def dft(y, k):
    N = len(y)
    result = 0
    for n in range(N):
        result += y[n] * np.exp(-1j * 2*np.pi/N * n * k)
    return result


# In[4]:


c_k = [dft(y_n, k) for k in range(len(y_n))]
c_k


# ``c_k`` contains the values of our coefficients, i.e. $c[k]$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3$ **Hz**, i.e.,
# 
# $$c[0] = 20, c[1] = -4i, c[2] = 8, c[3] = +4i.$$

# In[5]:


fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(3,3))
f = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3])
ax.scatter(f, np.abs(np.array(c_k)), label=r'$|c[n]|$')
ax.set_ylim((0,20.5))
ax.set_xticks([0, 1, 2, 3])
ax.set_yticks([0, 5, 10, 15, 20])
ax.set_xlabel(r'f (Hz)')
ax.set_ylabel(r'$|c[n]|$');


# Since we have 4 samples, i.e., $N=4$, we have to divide by 4 to compute the respective amplitudes.
# Since $y(t)$ is a real-valued function we already know that
# 
# $$c[n] = \overline{c[N-n]}.$$
# 
# and the amplitude is given by 
# 
# $$\frac{2}{N} \cdot c[n], \text{ if there is another } c[N-n] $$
# 
# otherwise it is
# 
# $$\frac{1}{N} \cdot c[n]$$
# 
# Furthermore, because of *[Nyquistâ€“Shannon sampling theorem](theorem-sampling)* we can not compute the amplitude (and phase) of frequencies greater than 2 Hz.
# In general, all $c[n]$ with $n > \frac{N}{2}$ are **invalid** because of *[aliasing](def-aliasing)*.
# Therefore, $c[3] = 4i$ is ''incorrect''.
# We can not distinguish the sinosoid of frequency $1$ from the sinosoid of frequency $3 = 1 + f_s$.
# Therefore, 
# 
# $$c[1] = 2 \cdot 4i = 8i.$$
# 
# In summary,
# 
# $$A_0 = \frac{1}{N} c[0] = \frac{20}{4} = 5, \quad A_1 = \frac{2}{4} c[1] = \frac{8}{4} = 2, \quad A_3 = \frac{1}{4} c[2] = \frac{12}{4} = 3$$
# 
# Now you might wonder what happened to the [complex number](sec-complex-numbers) $c[1] = -4i$?
# Remember, multiplying by $i$ equates to a counterclockwise rotation by 90 degrees.
# The ''cosine-part'' of the complex number represents the real part.
# Therefore, the **phase** of the cosine with the fundamental frequency is shifted by $-\pi/2$.
# Which is true for $y(t)$.
# 
# ### IDFT
# 
# Let's now apply the IDFT:

# In[6]:


def idft(c, n):
    N = len(c)
    result = 0
    for k in range(N):
        result += c[k] * np.exp(1j * 2*np.pi/N * k * n)
    return 1/N * result


# In[7]:


iy_n = [idft(c_k, n) for n in range(len(c_k))]
iy_n


# If we neglect the small numerical errors, we get the correct function values $y[n]$ for $n = 0, 1, 2, 3$ back again.
# The imaginary part of the complex numbers are approximately zero because $y(t)$ is a real-valued function.
# 
# ## Fast Fourier Transform
# 
# TODO
# 
# ## FFT in SuperCollider
# 
# TODO
# 
# To compute the DFT and IDFT in [SuperCollider (SC)](https://supercollider.github.io/) we use the FFT and IFFT respectively.
# For that purpose SC offers us a [FFT](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/FFT.html) and [IFFT](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/IFFT.html) unit generator, respectively.
# 
# ```isc
# 
# (
# {
#     var in, chain, freq = 200;
#     in = SinOsc.ar(freq)
#     chain = FFT(LocalBuf(2048), in);
#     IFFT(chain) // inverse FFT
# }.play;
# )
# 
# ```
