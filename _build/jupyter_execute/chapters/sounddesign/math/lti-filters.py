# # LTI Filters
# 
# *Linear filters* process time-varying input signals to produce output signals, subject to the constraint of *linearity*.
# In most cases these linear filters are also time *invariant* (or *shift invariant*) in which case they can be analyzed exactly using [LTI](def-linear-time-invariant) ('linear time-invariant') system theory.
# 
# ```{admonition} Linear Time-invariant Filters (LTI)
# :name: def-linear-time-invariant
# :class: definition
# 
# Let $x(t)$ be the input signal and $y(t)$ be the output signal of a filter.
# Then a filter is *linear time-invariant* if the following two conditions hold:
# 
# 1. Linearity: $a \cdot x(t)$ translates to $a \cdot y(t)$ and $x_1(t) + x_2(t)$ translate to $y_1(t) + y_2(t)$ (superposition principle).
# 2. Time-invariant: whether we apply an input to the filter now or some time later does not matter. The filters effect does not change over time.
# 
# ```
# 
# For example, if we modulate the cutoff frequency of a filter, it is no longer *time-invariant*.
# To analyse the behaviour of a *linear filter* one looks at two different effects.
# 
# 1. **Frequency response** (frequency domain): how does the amplitude and phase of a frequency $f$ changes.
# 2. **Impulse response** (time domain): how does the amplitude over time change.
# 
# ## Frequency Response
# 
# The frequency response of a filter tells us how it effects the amplitude and phase of a frequency of the input signal.
# [LTI filters](def-linear-time-invariant) can be characterized in the frequency domain by the *[Z-transform](sec-z-transform)* with respect to the input $x[n]$ and output signal $y[n]$.
# As a result of the properties of these transforms, the output of the system in the frequency domain is the product of the [*transfer function*](sec-trensfer-function) and the transform of the input $x[n]$.
# In other words, convolution in the time domain is equivalent to multiplication in the frequency domain.
# 
# If $H(z)$ is the *transfer function* of the filter, then plugging in $e^{i \omega}$ into $H(\cdot)$ gives us the *frequency response* $H(e^{i \omega})$.
# 
# ```{admonition} Frequency response
# :name: def-frequency-response
# :class: definition
# 
# The *frequency response* of a *linear filter* be represented in one formula (see section [Complex Numbers](sec-complex-numbers))
# 
# \begin{equation}
# H(e^{i \omega}) = \underbrace{G(\omega)}_{\text{Amplitude}} \cdot \underbrace{e^{i \mathcal{\Theta}(\omega)}}_{\text{Phase}},
# \end{equation}
# 
# where $G(\omega) = |H(e^{i \omega})|$ is the *amplutide frequency response* and $\mathcal{\Theta}(\omega) = \angle H(e^{i \omega})$ the *phase response* of the filter.
# 
# ```
# 
# The *gain* $G(\omega)$ in frequency $f = \frac{\omega}{2 \pi}$ is equal to the frequency amplitude of the input signal divided by the frequency amplitude of the output signal:
# 
# \begin{equation}
# G(\omega) = \frac{O(\omega)}{I(\omega)}.
# \end{equation}
# 
# ```{admonition} Gain of LTI Filters

# Frequency response of a first-order Butterworth lowpass filter. By Alejo2083 - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, [link](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=735081).
# ```
# 
# The *[frequency response](def-frequency-response)* of a *2nd order Butterworth lowpass filter* is illustrated above. 
# The filter reduces the gain (amplitude) for frequencies above the cutoff frequency and shifts their phases.
# Well, that is not entirely true because the cutoff frequency is also reduced by 6 [decibel (dB)](sec-intensity), so the reduction starts a little bit below the cutoff frequency.
# Reducing the loudness by 6 dB means that the perceived level is reduced by a factor of 4.
# The top plot of {numref}`Fig. {number} <fig-butterworth-filter>` shows the reduction in amplitude.
# 
# The second effect of the filter is a phase shift; compare the bottom plot of {numref}`Fig. {number} <fig-butterworth-filter>`.
# This effect is crucial if we combine multiple filters because they interact!
# In other words: we can not just combine a high pass and lowpass filter to get the same result as a band pass filter!
# 
# The following code is an example of a band pass filter.
# First, we use a lowpass and high pass filter; then a band pass filter.
# The results sound very similar but not identical.
# 
# ```isc
# ({
#     var sig = LFSaw.ar(500) ! 2 * 0.5;
#     sig = HPF.ar(sig, 200);
#     sig = LPF.ar(sig, 300);
#     sig
# }.play;)
# 
# ({
#     var sig = LFSaw.ar(500) ! 2 * 0.5;
#     var bandwidth = 100;
#     var cuttoffFeq = 200;
#     sig = BPF.ar(sig, 250, rq: bandwidth / cuttoffFeq);
#     sig
# }.play;)
# ```
# 
# For completeness I also want to mention the inverse filter of a band pass filter: the band reject filter ``BRF``.
# The following example rejects frequencies between 200 and 300 Hz, i.e., the inverse operation as before.
# 
# ```isc
# ({
#     var sig = LFSaw.ar(500) ! 2 * 0.5;
#     var bandwidth = 100;
#     var cuttoffFeq = 200;

# (sec-analysis-simple-filter)=
# ## Analysis of a Simple Filter
# 
# Let $x[n]$ be an input signal, $y[n]$ the output signal of the filter and $f_s = \frac{1}{T}$ the sample rate.
# Let use start with a very *simple filter*:
# 
# \begin{equation}
# y[n] = x[n] + x[n-1], \quad n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots
# \end{equation}
# 
# Note that $x[t]$ is defined for $t = n T$ with $n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$
# Our *simple filter* is a [linear and time-invariant](def-linear-time-invariant) filter.
# The [OnePole](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/OnePole.html) unit generator is a flexible version of this filter.
# 
# You might suspect that, since it is the simplest possible *lowpass filter*, it is also somehow the worst possible lowpass filter. 
# How bad is it? 
# In what sense is it bad? How do we even know it is a lowpass filter at all? 
# The answers to these and related questions will become apparent when we find the [frequency response](def-frequency-response) of this filter.
# 
# Our goal is to use a test singal that consists of only one frequency and then reformulate $y[n]$ such that we arrive at
# 
# \begin{equation*}
# y[n] = H(e^{i \omega}) \cdot x[n],
# \end{equation*}
# 
# where $H(\omega)$ has to be independent of $n$.
# 
# We start by using test signals, i.e., we define $x[n]$ to be a sinusoid containing **one** specific frequency $f$.
# Therefore, we assume:
# 
# \begin{equation*}
# x[n] = A \cdot e^{i(2\pi f n T + \phi)}.
# \end{equation*}
# 
# ```isc
# // here we test for f = f_s / 5
# (	
# {
#   var sig = SinOsc.ar(s.sampleRate/5);
#   [sig, OneZero.ar(sig, coef: 0.5, mul: 2)]
# }.plot(20/s.sampleRate)
# )
# ```
# 
# Let us simplify by assuming $A = 1$, $\phi = 0$ and $\omega = 2\pi f$ thus
# 
# \begin{equation*}
# x[n] = e^{i \omega n T}.
# \end{equation*}
# 
# Therefore, $y[n]$ is defined by
# 
# \begin{equation*}
# \begin{split}
# y[n] &= e^{i \omega n T} + e^{i \omega (n-1) T}\\
# &= e^{i \omega n T} + e^{i \omega n T} \cdot e^{-i \omega n T}\\
# &= (1 + e^{-i \omega T}) \cdot e^{i \omega n T}\\
# &= (1 + e^{-i \omega T}) \cdot x[n] = H(e^{i \omega}) \cdot x[n]
# \end{split}
# \end{equation*}
# 
# We get the same solution as we got using the [Z-transform](sec-simple-filter-example).
# The *gain* for this filter is
# 
# $$G(\omega) = |(1 + e^{-i \omega T})|$$
# 
# and the phase response is
# 
# $$\mathcal{\Theta}(\omega) = \angle 1 + e^{-i \omega T}.$$
# 
# We can further manipulate the formula for the *gain* by the following:
# 
# \begin{equation*}
# \begin{split}
# 1 + e^{-i \omega T} &= e^0 + e^{-i \omega T}\\
# &= (e^{i\omega T / 2} + e^{-i \omega T / 2}) \cdot e^{-i \omega T / 2}
# \end{split}
# \end{equation*}
# 
# using 
# 
# $$\cos(\phi) = \frac{e^{i\phi} - e^{-i \phi} }{2}$$
# 
# we get
# 
# \begin{equation*}
# \begin{split}
# 1 + e^{-i \omega T} &= 2 \cdot \cos(\omega T / 2) \cdot e^{-i \omega T / 2}
# \end{split}
# \end{equation*}
# 
# Thus
# 
# $$G(\omega) = |2 \cdot \cos(\omega T / 2) \cdot e^{-i \omega T / 2}| = 2|\cos(\omega T / 2)|.$$
# 
# Because of the [Nyquistâ€“Shannon sampling theorem](theorem-sampling), we can assume that we only look at frequencies $f$ such that $-f_s/2 \leq f \leq +f_s / 2$ holds.
# Therefore, the equation simplifies to
# 
# $$2\cos(\omega T / 2)$$
# 
# for $-\pi \leq \omega \leq \pi$.
# The following plot shows the amplitude [frequency response](def-frequency-response) in $\omega$.

# This *lowpass filter* has no phase delay at 0 Hz and a maximum delay of $-(\pi/2)T$ at the Nyquist frequency.
# **Note that both responses rely on the sample period** $T = = 1 / f_s$.

# High level filters such as [LPF](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/LPF.html) and [HPF](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/HPF.html) do not!
# 
# ```
# 
# Furthermore, the phase shift depends on $\omega$.
# It looks like this might lead to a phase distortion, however, this frequency-dependent delay is counteracted because doubling the frequency of the input halves its period, balancing the growth in retardation introduced by the filter.
# This linear dependence is actually necessary.
# 
# ```{admonition} Linear Phase Filters
# :name: def-linear-phase-filter

# If the phase response of the filter is a linear (straight-line) function of frequency (excluding phase wraps at $\pm 180$ degree), the filter is said to be *linear phase*.

# 
# Filters that are not linear phase can introduce *phase distortion*.
# 
# ```{admonition} General Form of a LTI Filter

# A LTI Filter may be expressed in general as follows:

# y[n] &= \text{Transfer function} \cdot \text{Circular motion}\\
# &= G(\omega) \cdot e^{i \mathcal{\Theta}(\omega)} \cdot A \cdot e^{i \omega n T + \phi}\\
# &= G(\omega) A \cdot e^{i(\omega n T + \Theta(\omega) + \phi)}
# \end{split}
# \end{equation}
# 
# ```
# 
# Thus, a filter can be characterized as circular motion with radius $G(\omega) A$ and phase $\Theta(\omega)+\phi$.
# The particular kind of filter implemented depends only on the definition of $G(\omega)$ and $\Theta(\omega)$.

# ## Impulse Response
# 
# The fundamental result in [LTI](def-linear-time-invariant) system theory is that any LTI system can be characterized entirely by a single function called the system's *impulse response* (in the time domain).
# The output of the filter $y[n]$ is simply the convolution of the input to the filter $x[n]$ with the system's *impulse response* $h[n]$.
# 
# ```{admonition} Impulse Response
# :name: def-impulse-response
# :class: definition
# 
# The *impulse response*, or *impulse response function (IRF)*, of a filter is its output when presented with a brief input signal, called an *impulse* $\delta(t)$.
# (In the discrete case we write $\delta[n]$ instead.)
# 
# ```
# 
# The *Dirac delta distribution* ($\delta$ distribution), also known as *unit impulse*, is a generalized function or distribution over the real numbers, whose value is zero everywhere expect at zero, and whose integral over the entire real line is equal to one:
# 
# $$\delta(t) = 0 \Rightarrow t \neq 0 \qquad \int_{-\infty}^\infty \delta(t) dt = 1.$$
# 
# Strictly speaking $\delta(t)$ not a function because it is not defined for $\delta(0)$.
# One can define
# 
# $$\delta(t) = \lim\limits_{b \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{|b| \sqrt{\pi}} e^{-(x/b)^2}.$$
# 
# Interestingly, the Dirac delta function is the neutral element of the [convolution](sec-convolution), that is,
# 
# $$(y * \delta) = (\delta * y) = y.$$
# 
# In the discrete case, things are more intuitive via the *Kronecker delta function* $\delta[n]$.
# 
# ```{admonition} Kronecker $\delta$-Function

# 1, & \text{if } n = 0,\\
# 0, & \text{otherwise}.
# \end{cases}
# \end{equation}
# 
# ```
# 
# It is the discrete analog of the *Dirac delta function*.
