# # Amplitude Modulation
# 
# If we modulate (change a value over time) the amplitude of an audible signal, we call this *amplitude modulation* (AM).
# We often speak of *amplitude modulation* when we modulate the amplitude within a value between 0 and 1 and use the term *ring modulation* if the modulator can also be negative.
# I put *amplitude* and [ring modulation](sec-rm) in the same basket.
# 
# As we will see, the frequency range of the modulation has a significant effect on the result.
# If it is low, e.g., in the range of 20 Hz, we call it [low-frequency modulation](sec-lfo).
# But first, let's start with some math to understand better what is happening.
# 
# ## Theory
# 
# I use the cosine function in this section instead of the sine because the math becomes a little simpler.
# Our basic waveform might be a simple cosine with an amplitude $A(t)$ and a frequency $f$:
# 
# \begin{equation}
# y(t) = A(t) \cdot \cos(2 \pi f_\text{car} t)
# \end{equation}
# 
# In AM the amplitude $A(t)$ is itself a function over time.
# Let us assume
# 
# \begin{equation}
# A(t) = A_\text{car} + A_\text{mod} \cdot \cos(2 \pi f_\text{mod} t)
# \end{equation}
# 
# then our audio signal is defined by
# 
# \begin{equation}
# y(t) = \left(A_\text{car} + A_\text{mod} \cdot \cos(2 \pi f_\text{mod} t) \right) \cdot \cos(2 \pi f_\text{car} t)
# \end{equation}
# 
# which we can rewrite as
# 
# \begin{equation}
# y(t) = A_\text{car} \cdot \cos(2 \pi f_\text{car} t) + A_\text{mod} \cdot \cos(2 \pi f_\text{mod} t) \cdot \cos(2 \pi f_\text{car} t)
# \end{equation}
# 
# We can now use the cosine rule for multiplication, which gives us
# 
# \begin{equation}
# \begin{split}
# y(t) = \ & A_\text{car} \cdot \cos(2 \pi f_\text{car} t) \ + \\
# \ & \frac{1}{2} A_\text{mod} \cdot \cos(2 \pi (f_\text{car} + f_\text{mod}) t) \Â + \\
# \ & \frac{1}{2} A_\text{mod} \cdot \cos(2 \pi (f_\text{car} - f_\text{mod}) t).
# \end{split}
# \end{equation}
# 
# This looks complicated but if we look at the Fourier transformation of $y(t)$, we can identify three frequencies within the spectrum:
# 
# 1. the carrier frequency $f_\text{car}$ with an amplitude $A_\text{car}$,
# 2. the sum of the carrier and modulation frequency $f_\text{car} + f_\text{mod}$ with an amplitude of $1/2 \cdot A_\text{mod}$ and
# 3. the difference of the carrier and modulation frequency $f_\text{car} - f_\text{mod}$ with an amplitude of $1/2 \cdot A_\text{mod}$.
# 
# ## Effect
# 
# If the modulation frequency is low, that is, in the range of $0$ and $20$ Hz, we can recognize an amplitude modulation by the change of amplitude in $y(t)$.
# However, if we choose a modulation frequency in the range of audible frequencies, we no longer really modulate the amplitude of the signal $y(t)$ but the frequencies of the signal.
# 
# For example, if we use $A_\text{car} = A_\text{mod} = 1$ and $f_\text{car} = 400$ Hz, $f_\text{mod} = 250$ Hz, the signal consists of three frequencies:
# 
# 1. $400$ Hz (center)
# 2. $400 + 250 = 650$ Hz (sum) and
# 3. $400 - 250 = 150$ Hz (difference), compare {numref}`Fig. {number} <fig-am-frequencies>`.
# 
# We can listen to this effect using the following code:
# 
# ```isc
# (
# Spec.add(\freq, [100, 600]);
# Spec.add(\freqmod, [0.01, 600]);
# Spec.add(\ampcar, [0, 1]);
# Spec.add(\ampmod, [0, 1]);
# 
# Ndef(\am, {
#     var sig, amp;
#     amp = \ampcar.kr(1) + (\ampmod.kr(1) * SinOsc.ar(
#             \freqmod.kr(5), 
#             0.5*pi)
#         );
#     sig = SinOsc.ar(\freq.kr(200), 0.5*pi);
#     sig = sig * amp * (1/3) ! 2;
# }).play;
# )
# 
# Ndef(\am).gui
# ```

# Snapshot of the stethoscope using a logarithmic frequency scale ($x$-axis).
# I use $A_\text{car} = A_\text{mod} = 1$ and $f_\text{car} = 400$ Hz, $f_\text{mod} = 250$ Hz. 
# ```
# 
# ## Techniques
# 
# In our example above, we used a fixed modulation frequency, i.e., if we change the carrier frequency the modulation frequency stays constant.
# 
# ### Direct Current
# 
# If we use, for example, $f_\text{car} = f_\text{mod} = 100$ Hz we achieve frequencies equal to $0$, $100$ and $200$ Hz.
# Zero means no oscillation which results in an offset ($y$-axis) of the signal.
# We call this a DC (direct current).
# 
# The following code generates a plot, such that you can observe this effect.
# 
# ```isc
# ({
#     var sig, amp;
#     amp = \ampcar.kr(1) + (\ampmod.kr(1) * SinOsc.ar(\freqmod.kr(100), 0.5*pi));
# 
#     sig = SinOsc.ar(\freq.kr(100), 0.5*pi);
#     sig = sig * amp * (1/3);
#     sig
# }.plot(1/100))
# ```
# 
# The result is depicted in {numref}`Fig. {number} <fig-am-dc-effect>`.
# All values $y(t)$ are shifted up, that is, in positive $y$-direction.

# This effect can be avoided by using the [LeakDC](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/LeakDC.html) *unit generator* which trys to center a signal on the amplitude-axis.

#     amp = \ampcar.kr(1) + (\ampmod.kr(1) * SinOsc.ar(\freqmod.kr(100), 0.5*pi));
# 
#     sig = SinOsc.ar(\freq.kr(100), 0.5*pi);
#     sig = sig * amp * (1/3);
#     sig = LeakDC.ar(sig);
#     sig

# 
# ### Clangoros Sound
# 
# When we play different notes by adjusting the carrier frequency without altering the modulation frequency, we achieve a non-harmonic, clangorous sound.
# The relationship between the frequencies maintains a fixed offset, meaning that for a high carrier or central frequency, the sum and difference frequencies are closer to the center frequency compared to those at lower center frequencies.
# 
# Across nearly all carrier frequencies, harmonics are absent from the signal.
# This inharmonicity results in a distinctly clangorous sound. It can be utilized to generate aggressive and conventionally "unmusical" sounds that shift dramatically as one progresses up and down the keyboard.
# 
# We can control the amount of clangor by raising or lowering the level of the modulator $A_\text{mod}$.
# 
# ### Harmonic and Inharmonic Timbres
# 
# Let us introduce a ratio $r$ between the carrier frequency and the modulation frequency such that:
# 
# \begin{equation}
# f_\text{mod} = r \cdot f_\text{car}.
# \end{equation}
# 
# which results in frequencies $f_\text{car}$ and
# 
# \begin{equation}
# f_\text{car} \pm f_\text{mod} = f_\text{car} \pm r \cdot f_\text{car} = (1 \pm r) \cdot f_\text{car}.
# \end{equation}
# 
# $r$ should be smaller or equals than $1$.
# 
# ```isc
# (
# Spec.add(\freq, [100, 600]);
# Spec.add(\ratio, [0.0, 10]);
# Spec.add(\ampcar, [0, 1]);
# Spec.add(\ampmod, [0, 1]);
# 
# Ndef(\am, {
#     var sig, amp, freqmod;
#     freqmod = \radio.kr(1) * \freq.kr(200);
#     amp = \ampcar.kr(1) + (\ampmod.kr(1) * SinOsc.ar(freqmod, 0.5*pi));
# 
#     sig = SinOsc.ar(\freq.kr(200), 0.5*pi);
# 
#     sig = sig * amp * (1/3) ! 2;
# }).play;
# )
# ```
# 
# We get a harmonic relationship if the ratio is an integer, but this is a special case!
# In general, the relationship is inharmonic, and we increase the inharmonicity if we use a ratio far away from a whole number!
# 
# Remember, the frequencies the signal has are $(1 \pm r) \cdot f_\text{car}$ and $f_\text{car}$.
# So the coefficients in order they are:
# 
# \begin{equation}
# (1 - r), 1, (1 + r).
# \end{equation}
# 
# For example, this gives us:
# 
# + $r=1/4$: $3/4, 1, 5/4$
# + $r=1/2$: $1/2, 1, 3/2$
# + $r=1/1$: $0, 1, 2$
# + $r=2/1$: $-1, 1, 3$
# + $r=3/2$: $-1/2, 1, 5/2$
# + ...
# 
# 
# ### Unipolar Amplitude Modulation
# 
# We speak of *unipolar* if the modulation signal either stays positive or negative over time.
# For example:
# 
# ```isc
# ({
#     var mod = SinOsc.ar(110, mul: 0.5, add: 0.5);
#     var car = mod * SinOsc.ar(440);
#     car;
# }.play;
# )
# ```

# In[2]:


audio_path = '../../sounds/am-unipolar.mp3'
ipd.Audio(audio_path)


# The effect is very similar.
# 
# ### Complex Amplitude Modulation
# 
# Instead of using sine waves we can also use other signals, for example we could use for one or both of the signals (carrier and modulator) a sawtooth wave.
# If the carrier signal consist of frequencies equal to $f_{\text{car},1}, \ldots, f_{\text{car},n}$ and the modulator consists of frequencies $f_{\text{mod},1}, \ldots, f_{\text{mod},m}$, then the resulting signal will consist of frequencies:
# 
# \begin{equation}
# f_{\text{car},1}, \ldots , f_{\text{car},n}, f_{\text{car},1} \pm f_{\text{mod},1}, f_{\text{car},2} \pm f_{\text{mod},1}, \ldots f_{\text{car},n} \pm f_{\text{mod},m}
# \end{equation}
# 
# thus it consists of $(n+1) \cdot m$ frequencies (if nothing cancels out).
# Consequently, AM can generate complex signals with a rich frequency spectrum in a computational inexpensive way.
# 
# ```isc
# ({
#     var mod = LFSaw.ar(110);
#     var car = mod * LFSaw.ar(200);
#     car = car * 0.25;
#     LeakDC.ar(car!2);
# }.play;
# )
# ```

# In[3]:


audio_path = '../../sounds/am-saw-110.mp3'
ipd.Audio(audio_path)


# ``car`` consists of frequencies of all harmonics of the carrier $200, 400, \ldots$ combined with all harmonics of the modulator $110, 220, 330, \ldots$.
# If we would use $100$ Hz for the fundamental of the modulator, the result would be a signal that does only contain odd harmonics.
# 
# ```isc
# ({
#     var mod = LFSaw.ar(100);
#     var car = mod * LFSaw.ar(200);
#     car = car * 0.25;
