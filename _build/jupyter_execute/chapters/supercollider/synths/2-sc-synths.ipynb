    "# SC Synthesizers\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of synth definitions and synth is central to SuperCollider.\n",
    "Everything is built around this fundamental concept.\n",
    "It can be confusing for beginners because there is a big difference between a synth as we know it in the real world and an instance of [Synth](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/Synth.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, a synth is an instrument that can be played.\n",
    "However, in ``sclang``, we distinguish between the instrument (as a potential/thing) and the played instrument (as a process).\n",
    "While the thing is an instance of [SynthDef](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/SynthDef.html), the process (an executed [signal-flow graph (SFG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-flow_graph)) is an instance of [Synth](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/Synth.html).\n",
    "If we instanciate a [Synth](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/Synth.html), defined by a specific [SynthDef](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/SynthDef.html) and its arguments, the signal processing begins and if we destroy the [Synth](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/Synth.html) it stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of introducing a new class for each new instrument which would lead to thousand of classes, each instrument is represented by a function, more precisely by *a unit generator graph function* that realizes *a signal-flow-graph (SFG)*.\n",
    "``sclang`` borrows this concept from functional programming languages.\n",
    "The SFG ultimately defines the instrument.\n",
    "At the same time, the synth definition provides an interface to play it.\n",
    "We generate synths by calling the defining function with different arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} SynthDef\n",
    ":name: def-synth-def\n",
    ":class: definition\n",
    "An instance of [SynthDef](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/SynthDef.html) represents a factory of a parameterizable signal-flow-graph.\n",
    "The graph can be executed (as [Synth](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/Synth.html) with different arguments) on the audio server.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "From the perspective of a musician, a synth definition is a parameterizable description of a piece of sound.\n",
    "A synth, on the other hand, is the process of playing that piece of sound with specific possibly modulated arguments (frequency, loudness, velocity, etc.).\n",
    "From a software developer's perspective, a synth definition is a factory that generates synths following its internal description defined by a function representing a signal-flow graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "A [SynthDef](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/SynthDef.html) object encapsulates the server-side representation of a synth definition and provides methods for creating new [Synth](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/Synth.html) objects on the server.\n",
    "It abstracts away all the low level communication (via [OSC](sec-osc)) between the client and the audio server.\n",
    "Furthermore, a [SynthDef](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/SynthDef.html) object can be serialized to the disk and streamed via the network to distant audio servers.\n",
    "[SynthDefs](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/SynthDef.html) are nothing more than compact representations of signal-flow graphs written down in text.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Synth\n",

    ":class: definition\n",
    "A [Synth](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/Synth.html) is a representation of an executed signal-flow-graph.\n",
    "It is the process that generates sound via the audio server.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "We use ``sclang`` to define a [SynthDef](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/SynthDef.html).\n",
    "It is defined on the client, and we must send it to the audio server.\n",
    "To generate sound, we have to tell the server to create a synth of one of its known [SynthDefs](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/SynthDef.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal workflow goes as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. define (all) your [SynthDef](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/SynthDef.html) via ``sclang``\n",
    "2. add them (all) to the audio sever **scsynth**\n",
    "3. create one or multiple synth on the server\n",
    "4. remove your synths from the server\n",
    "\n",
    "```isc\n",
    "(\n",
    "// (1) define the SynthDef\n",

    "There is no such thing as a server-side ``rrand`` function!\n",
    "Its evaluation is part of the definition of the signal-flow graph.\n",

    "However, there exists an alternate approach.\n",
    "Instead of employing \"standard\" variables, we have the option to utilize [NamedControls](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/NamedControl.html).\n",
    "Essentially, these are variables that can be controlled via [OSC messages](sec-osc).\n",
    "Given the syntax shortcuts that create [NamedControls](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/NamedControl.html) from a name or symbol, they are extremely convenient to use.\n",
    "You can define such a control in the following manner:\n",
    "\n",
    "```isc\n",
    "\\name.ar(values, lags, spec)\n",
    "\\name.kr(values, lags, fixedLag, spec)\n",
    "\\name.ir(values, lags, spec)\n",
    "\\name.tr(values, lags, spec)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The two characters after the ``.`` determine the rate and type of the [NamedControls](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/NamedControl.html).\n",
    "Using ``ar`` adds a new instance of [AudioControl](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/AudioControl.html) at *audio rate*, ``kr`` or ``ir`` adds a new instance of [Control](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/Control.html), either with continuous *control rate* signal ``kr`` or a static value ``ir`` and using ``tr`` adds a new instance of [TrigControl](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/TrigControl.html).\n",
    "The static value of ``ir`` is set at the time the synth starts up, and is subsequently unchangeable.\n",
    "A [Control](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/Control.html) is a [unit generator](sec-ugens) that can be set and routed externally to interact with a running synth.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Named Control\n",
    ":class: remark\n",
    "If one uses the same [NamedControls](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/NamedControl.html) in a [SynthDef](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/SynthDef.html) multiple times, its ``value`` and all other arguments have to be identical\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If ``lags`` is given, the [Lag](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/Lag.html) unit generator is applied and if ``fixedLag`` is set to be ``true`` a [LagControl](https://doc.sccode.org/Classes/LagControl.html) is used, meaning that ``lags`` can not be modulated at the advantage that fewer unit generators are required.\n",
    "I already discussed the lagging of a signal in section [Signal Lagging](sec-signal-lagging).\n",
