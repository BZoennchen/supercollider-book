<h1>Lost Futures – A Romantic Response<a class="headerlink" href="#lost-futures-a-romantic-response" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<div><p>What, if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: ‘This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more’ […] Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: ‘You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine. – Nietzsche</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In its early stage in 1990, <em>cyberculture</em> hinted at an innovative utopia of widespread collaboration and collective expression, where ideas, knowledge, and power are evenly distributed across a decentralized web;
The internet felt like a gift to humanity.
The driving force of its invention, the destructive possibilities in the form of a nuclear Armageddon, foreshadowed its instrumentalization.
In 1960 computational performance was residuated in large mainframe computers, and their power became a critical indicator in the arms race between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.
To improve their workload, sharing these resources via a network was key.
No wonder that, at that time, computers haunted our popular imagination as bleak tools of the cold war.
They embodied the rigid organization and mechanical conformity that made the military-industrial complex possible.
Still, many people, primarily motivated out of curiosity and the belief to do something of worth, were involved in building the network and, finally, the <em>World Wide Web</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>There was no ‘Eureka!’ moment. It was not like the legendary apple falling on Newton’s head […].
Inventing the World Wide Web involved my growing realisation that there was a power in arranging ideas in an unconstrained, weblike way. And that awareness came to me through preceisely that kind of process. – Tim Berners-Lee</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The reaction to the cold war establishment, in combination with a firm idea of the internet, led to an ironic transformation.
The horizon was bright.
People kept dreaming about utopian futures.
Later, dreams were further amplified by the Hippie movement of 1967.
After all, the roots of many tech gurus were a cultist environment promoting individual freedom, non-conformity, free love, drugs, and rock music.
Thanks to their vision, counterculturalists and technologists alike joined together to reimagine computers as tools for personal liberation, the building of virtual and decidedly alternative communities, and the exploration of bold new social frontiers.
Even though the internet was never really free from power concentrations, it gave us a powerful image of a possible future;
a <em>fever dream</em> of an alternative structure of society.
But what happened to this dream?</p>
<p>Looking at the big cities in the U.S. around 1975, one can observe two groups of radical left-wing artists.
One group wanted to change material realities through collective activism.
The other wanted to change people’s minds.
While the first group embraced bureaucracy, hierarchies, and organizations, the second believed in doing away with all of those things and turning instead to small-scale technologies, LSD, etc.
But drugs without reason are like an escape kit without an instruction manual.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Taking MDMA is like improving [Microsoft] Windows: no matter how much tinkering Bill [Gates] does, MS Windows will always be shit because it is built on top of the rickety structure of DOS – Mark Fisher</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In his final remarks, Mark Fisher argues that taking ecstasy will always fuck up in the end because the human operating system has not been taken out of dismantled.</p>
<p>In the end, this split was damaging because, in a communal system built around shared consciousness, people with charisma start to lead, and cultural norms kick in.
Distributing resources relies on negotiation and, thus, bureaucracy.
The undemocratic impulse to free oneself from bureaucracy always looms as an attraction in the background of individuals who want to realize their idea of a “good” society.
The collective drive lost its strength, and a mood of disillusion spread across artists.
They no longer tried to change existing power structures and material realities but critiqued the status quo via personal expressions.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It was the mood of the era, and the revolution was deferred indefinitely.
And while we were dozing, the money crept in.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>One might argue that the communalist movement led to a turning away from politics.
It led us to the self as the basis of political change, which goes hand in hand with the upcoming neoliberal ideology.
Where JFK spoke about <em>obligations to society</em>, Ragon and Clinton saw <em>personal responsibility</em> as the only solution to many social problems.
The missing component that was maybe necessary to realize the <em>fever dream</em>, that is, the democratization of social, economic, and ecological life, was the ability to negotiate.
And a decentralized solution seemed preferable – a restructuring of the communication network.
Instead, the cultist disruption centered around giving power to “the right” people.
But, who decides what are “the right” people?</p>
<p>We can observe the cultist ethos in today’s <em>Silicon Valley</em>.
Most representatives of the IT industry argue against regulation on the promise of a new satisfying society.
The belief to do good led to an anti-democratic and hubris mindset.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Do not stifle our creativity and we will build you new gadgets.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>It was and is all about exceptionally bright individuals, tribes, and rebellions.
It was and is all about heroic stories of bootstrapped individuals pursuing conscious change.
It was and is all about power to people instead of power to the people.
And the concentration of power is not necessarily enforced.
People desire domination; they want someone for the dirty work; someone that hides the dark truths about our complex reality; someone with easy answers.
Therefore, paradoxically, politics of personal responsibility leads to irresponsibility because in a society of individuals fully responsible for their haves and not haves, there is nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>Consider google, a company that treats its engineers quite well, offers flexible workspaces and has built a culture of collaboration and creativity that looks very communal (with the exception, of course, that workers do not own the company).
However, around those engineers, low-paid cafeteria workers who are making something very close to minimum wage, and often lack the ability to get proper health insurance, are exploited.
That’s the kind of old communal mindset.
Bring together a kind of elite, give them a shared mindset and the resources they need to live in that mindset, and you can surround them with troubled workers.
Seemingly paradoxically, this elitism correlates with esoterism and cults because those people tend to believe to be special or at least to know something special, which can lead to a kind of fascism, i.e., the very thing those people should heavily oppose.</p>
<p>Another example is the <em>effective altruism</em> movement which intends to do good effectively.
The idea here is that one should maximize the well-being of others with mathematical precision, i.e., statistical reasoning.
Instead of giving money to the beggar right in front, one should instead support projects with a much bigger impact.
Sounds not too bad, right?
Following this logic, one should earn or concentrate a lot of money to become an effective altruist – they call it <em>earning to give</em>.
Instead of relying on the “intelligence” of the collective, effective altruists rely on their “superior” wisdom.
This might be effective in the short run, but it is undemoractic, it reveals a suspicious mindset, it is a kind of elitism, and it favors some unmeasurble future state above the present.
At what point will the altruist give power to the people?
Moreover, isn’t it far too easy to hide behind some imagined future?
One can easily suggest brutal actions in the name of a better future.</p>
<p>The <em>crypto movement</em> is yet another example that perfectly blends into <em>effective altruism</em>.
Again, the idea sounds great: a decentralized banking system to break down national borders.
Apart from the many technical issues, this idea collapses if we think about it for only a moment.
If money is power and it can no longer be controlled in a central way, then power is highly distributed – that is the promise.
There is, however, one significant caveat: money has to be distributed evenly amongst the world population.
Otherwise, the whole system is just another form of power concentration.
Regardless of the underlying system, a more evenly distributed capital is what matters.
Anonymization does not help; quite the contrary.
The idea that fewer regulations lead to a “better” society has been proven wrong countless times.
You can try and see what happens if you drive in the wrong lane.
What matters is the form of negotiation (central, decentral, direct, indirect, evenly distributed power, concentrated power) and not if we negotiate at all.
We can see how power concentration leads to disaster within the crypto and effective altruism movement in the case of Bankman-Fried.
He is a crypto enthusiast and proponent of the effective altruism movement; he was once their wealthiest member.
Today he is charged with wire fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, securities fraud, securities fraud conspiracy, and money laundering.
I do believe that effective altruists want to do good in the world, but their means reveal a deep distrust in institutions and the people, and instead of reformation or rebellion, they try to infiltrate and use concentrated power individualistically.</p>
<p>There is no question that the concentration of power, knowledge, and capital led to innovation and an incredible diversity of consumer goods.
However, did it lead to a better society?
Has the rise of information technology and the expansion of what was originally the military-industrial complex substantially improved our lives?
The distribution of material, as well as intellectual goods – the haves and the have-nots – are drifting apart, and the middle class is melting.
Is it really the case that big companies have to be owned by a few individuals?
Wouldn’t it be a good idea if we all owned some piece of the machinery for which we are responsible?
Wouldn’t we care more about how we produce if we can no longer hide behind some dominating “big brother”?</p>
<p>Even if there are islands of rebellion, today, I realize that the tech explosion intensified the degree of monetarization and commercialization.
We innovated like crazy, but we have not solved some of the problems of inequality and diversity that were core to the people of 1960.
Furthermore, the psychological effect of the colonialization of our literal time might be more catastrophic than expected.
We live in a business ontology in which the enterprise is the holy grail, and entrepreneurs are our disciples.
The church lost its power, but our religious tendencies are still vibrant.
According to <em>Baudrillard</em>, the use value of commodities is over-coded by their sign value.
And those signs (“the code”) can be exchanged like money.
I think <em>Baudrillard</em> has a point.
Objects and events are oversaturated with meaning and significance, while real but boring politics is stripped of any meaning.
News is no longer news but a presentation of interpretations and the interpretation and discussion of these interpretations and discussions.
Instead of looking at a situation without moralizing it beforehand and analyzing it carefully, we rush to simple stories and a clear distinction between good and evil.
Instead of living our political freedom (by voting, protesting, and revolting) and our freedom to discover and create, we celebrate the last freedom we seem to recognize: consumption.</p>
<p>The accelerating machine is brutal, exploitive, irrational, and completely out of control.
We have proposals from <em>Ruth Benedict</em> and <em>Gregory Bateson</em> who suggest that we need to build multimedia environments in which people can find themselves by selecting images and sounds from around them such that they can fulfill their individual destinies and thereby build a more democratic, less hierarchical, more egalitarian sort of society.
We spot ideas from <em>Norbert Wiener</em>.
At the same time, we can find a critique of hierarchy echoing <em>Margaret Mead</em> and <em>Erich Fromm</em> who pushed back publicly against fascism and racism and openly advocated for a sexually diverse America.
The tech-sphere still draws from contradictory concepts such as elitism, humanism, cybernetics, trans- and posthumanism, accelerationism, egalitarianism, eugenics, longtermism (a relatively new troubling trend), and of course, individualism.
Technological “progress” is seen as unavoidable, and the “objective” reality is confused with the measurable or observable.
Consequently, <em>death</em> is discriminated against because it has no significance within a <em>consumer society</em> of individuals.</p>
<p>And what about art?
I stand by the radical view that art can never be seen as innocent, grown from a world of money-making commodities.
It is always influenced by that profit-oriented environment.
Even if its creators could deprive themselves of that world entirely, the audience can not.
Money, as a stand-in for divine-like comparability, poisons art.
Moreover, capitalism drives us into a cycle of endless consumption and repetitive cloning.
Most of us can no longer create and bring out what’s inside but consume what’s in front.
Sure, there might be some short period in which something genuinely creative can emerge.
Still, soon after, its singularity will be destroyed by its assimilation into a sellable, thus quantifiable product.
Money is indifferent; that’s the beauty and horror of it.</p>
<p>Through an ongoing process of decontextualizing, copying, alternating, and recontextualizing, this indifference creeps into all things.
That may be one of the reasons my reality feels thinner than it should be.
After all, indifference is the opposite of life itself which is all about differentiation – bodies, cells, planets, cultures, and their environment.
Our <em>being there</em> (<em>Dasein</em>) can not be dissected and can not be understood by science because science breaks phenomena into pieces.
Science has to quantify and has to measure; it has to be blind toward <em>Dasein</em>.
Furthermore, science presupposes <em>Dasein</em>.
It is like time for which any articulation of what it is can only happen in time.
We need time to explain time, and we need <em>Dasein</em> to grasp <em>Dasein</em>.</p>
<p><em>Bernard Stiegler</em> believes that many people live in <em>symbolic misery</em>.
He notes in <em>Symbolic Misery</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The question of “culture”, as it is formulated in its essence by art, is now more than ever at the heart of the economy, of industry, and of politics: the <em>sensible</em> community is today entirely fabricated by the <em>technologies</em> of what <em>Deleuze</em> called <em>control societies</em>; and it is essentially on this front that the international economic struggle is taking place. – Bernard Stiegler</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The mystical aspect of the workers’ life has no more place in a <em>control society</em>.
They can choose, but only from a set of pretty similar possibilities.
Nothing radical is in sight.
The horizon of what is sensible has narrowed down.
We are auto-regulatory and self-controlling;
Many of us feel empty, haunted by <em>lost futures</em>, and from time to time overwhelmed by nostalgia, while the <em>Rage Against the Machine</em> seems now unimaginable.</p>
<p>The university is one institution where we can observe this dissolution of diverse and critical thought, especially in Europe.
The <em>Bologna</em> process homogenized and instrumentalized the education system.
Students are allowed to think but only so far as it leads to “productivity” (in an economic sense) – to reproduce – and align with an unquestioned economic system of exploitation.
Most of the time, universities of today teach emotionally detached students to remember specific rules such that they can apply them in the next exam to get a good grade.
It is horrifying that one of the most questions students in the first-semester ask is: how will the exam look like?
Is this topic relevant to the exam? Students demand a list of actions they ought to do to get an A with certainty.
And they will cheat the system wherever possible if it will bring them closer to that goal.
Most students are not fascinated by the endless playground of reality. They are interested in something other than the experience of learning and understanding but in the final product, i.e., the certificate to get access to a well-paid job.
And let’s not forget that the teachers of the future are the students of today.
By no means is this the student’s fault.
They play the system of control that demands them to do so.
We stopped punishing.
Nowadays, the network of machines filters and channels the flow of desires and the possible.
It seems impossible to depart from this school-like system since the new generation of professors grew up in it.
Nowadays, education is consumption.
However, it would be unfair to say that this path is not under heavy critique and that there is no pressure to adjust the course.
There is, in fact, more and more pressure, but what changes this will lead to has yet to be decided.
But again, when the collective depends on the altruism of (unelected) individuals to support their research and education plans, then democracy is either under threat or just a lie.</p>
<p>The generation of 1967 and most of today’s educators are perfectly aligned with today’s consumerism. Consumerism is everywhere.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>People all over the world spend countless hours of their lives every week being fed entertainment in the forms of movies, TV shows, newspapers, YouTube videos, the internet.
And it is ludicrous to believe that this stuff doesn’t alter our brains.
And it is also equally ludicrous to believe that, at the very least, this mass distraction and manipulation is not convenient for the people who are in charge. People are starving.
They may not know it because they are being fed mass-produced garbage.
The packaging is colorful and loud, but it’s being produced in the same factories that make pop-tarts and IPads; by people sitting around thinking: what can we do to bring people to buy more of these?
And they are very good at their jobs.
But that is what we are getting because that’s what they’re making. They’re selling you something.
And the world is built on this now.
Politics and governments are built on this; corporations are built on this; interpersonal relationships are built on this; and we are starving, all of us; and we are killing each other;
and we hate each other;
and we are calling each other liars and evil because it’s all become marketing, and we want to win; because we are lonely and empty and scared.
And we are led to believe winning will change all that. But there is no winning – Charlie Kaufman</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Our dreams, feelings, moments, culture, and intimacy are now open for sale, and there is an attempt to introduce scarcity to digital information itself.
To do business means to be at war.
Famously President J. W. Bush encouraged his people to go shopping more while waging an unjustified war in Iraq.
Recently he misspoke, calling the invasion of Ukraine:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>the decision of one man to launch a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion of Iraq.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Of course, he meant Ukraine.
Probably just an old man’s memorizing problem, but it perfectly illustrates the absurdity of our consumer society.
It also shows the difficulty of distinguishing between simulation and reality – between constructed stories and myths and <em>the real</em>: a senseless, infinitely complex shadow of what we call reality.</p>
<p>One obsolete alternative that is getting more and more traction is fascism.
By telling the tales of genetic inferiority, fascism is one way to justify inequality and the annihilation of billions, facing the fact that endless material growth is impossible and that many regions will become uninhabitable.
Right-wing forces are on the rise.
They can give the people, beaten down and affected by their <em>symbolic misery</em>, some short-term relief.
They can give easy answers to very complex questions.
Look at the distribution of material goods across the world’s population. You can come up with mainly three explanations: either there is a power imbalance that led to the exploitation of many, or racial/cultural inferiorities are real, or many people like to live in poverty.
No one believes the third explanation, which leaves us with the easy racist answer and a complex answer that is a call for action.
<em>Fascism gets things done</em> is one of its appealing promises.
The phenomenon of someone like Trump might signify our desperate desire to find a story that makes sense of our realities.
People are thirsty; some want to push the red button of destruction to force anything different than the status quo – any change is desirable, regardless of its destructive potential.
Ringwingers are sophisticated myth tellers.
They know how to exploit symbolism.
When Trump talks about “<em>closed factories</em> scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation”, his ghostwriters invoke a postapocalyptic image of desolation.
The factories signify the ruins of a once great civilization similar to ancient temples.
As such, the <em>factory</em> is a <em>sign</em> for the loss of manufacturing, the betrayal of politicians, and the outsourcing of production to other countries.
Whether or not this is true makes no actual difference to the signification of the factories as the “<em>tombstones of American greatness</em>”.
The power of the myth deforms facts such that they serve an emotional narrative of loss and ruin.
The “rusted-out tombstone factories” do not signify, as we might expect, factory production since production appears to be steadily increasing.
It is a code for the greatness of America and its people.
And since this greatness lies in the past, it can only be a <em>white greatness</em>.
We might look down on this logic but let’s face it: we are also living by a myth; the myth of the successful unlimited domination and exploitation of nature by technology and an economic system that is based on endless material and productivity growth.</p>
<p>So, is it all over?
Is the end already baked into our current condition?
Is it time to give up?
Let it play out, and see how it goes?
As individuals, we are powerless.
And even if somehow some power structures push for a change, <em>system theory</em> tells us that the effect on the system can not be predicted if we assume that our planet, with all its creatures and environment, is an open complex system.
We could resign and find the last joyful moments in <em>hedonic nihilism</em>, but that seems just not enough.</p>
<p>My response is a Nietzschean response, and I am fully aware of the danger looming in Nietzsche’s texts.
I am also fully aware of the tension between Nietzsche’s <em>superman</em> and my critique of <em>elitism</em> and the right.
I am a theft, stealing those concepts that I deem worthy, e.g., <em>life affirmation</em> as a guiding principle, moral as a <em>dangerous virus</em>, the <em>body</em> as something as important and enjoyable as the mind, and the <em>importance of power</em>, the <em>overcoming of oneself</em> are lessons I take from Nietzsche.
To change our complex system, we have to change the flow of energy.
And instead of contributing a lot of energy into moralizing, we should look for power and use it to adjust the energy flow.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>[In the speech] MLK talked about the fallacy that certain Christians misunderstood love as a seeding of power, and then Nietzsche came along and rejected Christian morality because he thought it denied someone’s vitality, the will to power in a healthy sense. MLK said, ‘love without power is sentimental and anemic, and power without love is abusive and corrosive’. I want the left to have [this] Machiavelli[an-side] so that we can have the strategy, ruthlessness, and clarity to actually win these battles and be ruthless with institutions. And then I want us to learn how to be really kind to each other, welcoming of a broad set, and actually have a movement that has the capacity to do that. – Micheal Brooks</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>A lot is going on.
Many new grassroots movements emerged during the last ten years, and they all envision a new future and craft their values.
Furthermore, they seemed to have learned from the <em>fever dream</em> by recognizing the importance of collective action and an inclusive environment.
So maybe there is room for a reinvented <em>cyberculture</em>.
Despite <em>Mark Fisher’s</em> declaration that the real will arrive sooner or later pushes us to revolt against <em>Capitalist Realism</em>.
The story politicians tell the everyday person no longer seems to reflect their reality.
The real shimmers through the code.
Reality and our model of reality no longer fit together:
Google and the cafeteria workers, the danger of ecological, social, and economic collapse due to climate change and the space exploring billionaires, more and more comfortable yet more and more unsatisfaction, more and faster communication yet less social movement, more and more donations by billionaires yet more and more inequality, the fantasy of individualized high-tech underground car transportation systems yet no investments in public transportation, hungry people yet supermarkets packed with expensive stuff, homeless people yet the resources to build a home for anybody, and the list goes on and on.
The discrepancy between the new gadget to consume and people bagging for food triggers a strange feeling; the absurd explodes into our faces.
Something is entirely off.</p>
<p>Is brutal exploitation of one another the only way to build and keep a society for some worth living in?
Is competition and fear the only way to be productive?
It may be if we keep the hierarchical structure of our society.
However, with today’s technology, we can implement many other forms of governance.
On this point, I agree with crypto enthusiasts.
And I believe that behavior emerges from the underlying system such that a society of suspicion requires competition while a society of trust relies on collaboration.</p>
<p>In the face of climate, ecological and economic disasters, we can no longer assume that endless material growth is a feasible economic strategy.
It never was, but now it is clear that it is no longer feasible in the short run – the stability of the current system is just a fantasy, but we still act as if it is feasible.
Like the people of the late <em>Soviet Union</em>, we are acting as if everything is going according to plan even though some climate catastrophes are already happening and others are realistically unavoidable.
From this perspective, <em>Capitalist Realism</em> is not <em>The End of History</em> but a sign of a failing system that is on the brink of collapse.
It is evident that our <em>senseless consumption</em> has to end or at least slow down radically, but the system demands consumption for its own survival.
It is built on consumption.
To believe that we can somehow consume us out of the disaster is pure madness.</p>
<p>I have two strategies in mind to defeat the myth of endless growth: a second <em>Enlightenment</em>, which is unlikely to occur, and the construction of a better myth.
We need a myth of our own, not only to push back against a fascist dystopia but to extend the horizon of the thinkable.
If there is only darkness on the horizon, lighting a candle can move the world.
As I already mentioned, some movements paint a vibrant vision of the future, which is good.
Moreover, art can be a place to start constructing or contributing to these new utopian futures to strive towards.</p>
<p>Disaster will arrive in my lifetime, but I still want to live my life in such a way that I welcome the demon forcing me to live it over and over again because I once experienced a moment of unimaginable, undescribable, and non-reproducible quality and beauty because I once truly recognized <em>the other</em>.
I doubt that acting negatively against the myth will break it because, in that case, we take part in the dialectic, which perfectly incorporates any resistance.
My unjustifiable belief is that the solution lies in creation and affirmation, not by criticizing without creating but by creating to criticize.
This hope stems from my incapability to foresee what is coming – uncertainty makes me uncanny but also gives me some hope.
This time, however, it has to be a collective project that affirms differences.
Failing tragical seems to me much more appealing than being <em>comfortable numb</em>.
This pessimistic viewpoint sounds bleak.
But I think it is essential to accept the possibility of a <em>dying world</em> and to come to peace with it in the same sense we come to peace with our finitude. Not to flee reality but instead to be in it, more than ever, and to take on that fight – to bring dignity, kindness, and love into a dying world.</p>
