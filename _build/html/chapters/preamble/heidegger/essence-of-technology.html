<span id="sec-essense-of-technology"></span><h1>The Essence of Technology<a class="headerlink" href="#the-essence-of-technology" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h1>
<p>In <em>Being and Time</em> (1927) <span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../misc/bibliography.html#id31" title="Martin Heidegger. Being and Time. Harper Perennial Modern Classics, 2008. ISBN 9780061575594.">Hei08</a>]</span> Heidegger argues <em>phenomenologically</em> that theoretical activities such as the natural sciences depend on views of time and space that narrow the understanding implicit in how we deal with the ordinary world of action and concern.
We cannot construct meaningful distance and direction, or understand the opportunities for action, from science’s neutral and mathematical understanding of space and time.
Indeed, this detached and supposedly <em>objective</em> scientific view of the world restricts our everyday understanding.
Our ordinary use of things and our <em>concernful dealings</em> within the world are pathways to a more fundamental and more truthful understanding of world and being than the sciences provide;
science flattens the richness of ordinary concern.</p>
<p>In his essay <em>The Question Concerning Technology</em> <span id="id2">[<a class="reference internal" href="../../misc/bibliography.html#id35" title="Martin Heidegger. Die frage nach der technik. 1954.">Hei54</a>]</span>, Heidegger challenges the prevailing views of technology as merely an instrument (a means to an end) and as a product of human activity.
He posits that while we perceive ourselves as creators of technology, in reality, technology originates from elsewhere.
Perceiving certain types of technology as instruments or tools is itself a technological <em>mode of understanding</em>.
Heidegger argues that there is no such thing as a purely instrumental object.
Instruments only manifest to those who interpret the world instrumentally.
In this view, technology is a way of comprehending the world that reduces it to raw material, encouraging us to see the world solely as a realm for our intervention.</p>
<p>To find a pre-scientific view on the matter, he goes back to ancient times.
In his view, the Greeks used the term <em>techne</em> to denote what we now call technology.
However, their concept of <em>techne</em> embraced both <em>art</em> and <em>technique</em>, something akin to our modern notion of <em>craft</em>.
For the Greeks, <em>techne</em> implied the act of bringing something into existence.
It was not about an engineer constructing an object; rather, the craftsman’s role was to assist in the emergence of something, so to say helping the material to take on a <em>form</em>.
A craftsman would never consider themselves as the absolute origin of the reality of what they were creating.
In Heidegger’s view, they would perceive themselves as facilitating the process of something coming into existence.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The causes bring something into appearance. They let it come forth into presence. – Martin Heidegger</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In stark contrast, modern technology is not seen as aiding something to emerge.
Instead, as Heidegger posits, it forces things into existence.
We have come to perceive ourselves as the source of what we create, believing that we are the origin of everything.
This is a highly specific way of interpreting the world, one that seemingly grants us the power to control everything around us.
Therefore, technology unveils the world in a particular way—it reveals the world as raw material and conceals <em>Being</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>essence of technology</em> as <em>enframing</em> (<em>Gestell</em>) is in its manner of <em>revealing</em> and <em>concealing</em>.
It is a way in which we encounter entities generally, including nature, ourselves, and, indeed, everything.
Heidegger claims that the <em>Gestell</em>, which becomes pervasively evident in our times with the advent of such technologies as the nuclear bomb, has been operating and developing itself from long ago, being itself the root of modern science’s instrumental character and its understanding of nature in terms of measurable extension.
This implies that technological entities have their distinct form of presence, persistence, and relationships between parts and wholes.
They have their unique ways of presenting themselves and the world in which they exist—technology is about dominance and control.
However, the heart of the issue lies not in any specific machine, process, or resource.
Instead, technology is <em>challenging</em> (<em>herausfordernd</em>): it is the way the <em>essence of technology</em> shapes our understanding of all things, and the existence of those things themselves—the all-encompassing manner in which we encounter and are encountered by the technological world.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>[Because of technology] all distances in time and space are shrinking [and] yet the hasty setting aside of all distances brings no nearness; for nearness does not consist in a small amount of distance. – Martin Heidegger</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>We seem to have become nearly incapable of experiencing this nearness, let alone comprehending it, as all things increasingly manifest to us in a technological fashion: We perceive and interact with them as what Heidegger describes as a <em>standing reserve</em>, akin to supplies in a storeroom, items of inventory awaiting direction and mobilization, assembly and disassembly, positioning and dismissal.
Everything presents itself merely as an energy source or as a subject for our orchestration.
We even perceive human abilities as if they were merely instruments for technological procedures, as when a labourer becomes nothing more than a tool for production.
Leaders, planners, along with the rest of us, are mere human assets to be managed, reorganized, and discarded.
Every single entity that manifests itself technologically thereby forfeits its unique autonomy and form.
We dismiss, conceal, or simply fail to perceive, other potentialities.</p>
<p>The mode of revealing that prevails in modern technology does not manifest as a bringing forth in the sense of <em>poiesis</em> (<em>Gestalt</em>).
Instead, the revealing that governs modern technology is a <em>challenging</em> (<em>Herausfordern</em>) one, which places an unreasonable demand on nature to provide energy that can be extracted and stored.
It’s important to note that, for Heidegger, the <em>challenge</em> precedes the unlocking, thus the <em>essence of technology</em> predates natural science.
It was technological thinking that first understood nature in such a way that nature could be challenged to unlock its forces and energy.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Modern technology is not applied natural science, far more is modern natural science the application of the essence of technology. [Nature is therefore] the fundamental piece of inventory of the technological standing reserve—and nothing else. – Martin Heidegger</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The nature of <em>being-in-the-world</em> (<em>Dasein</em>)—basically Heidegger’s concept of a human being—is such that we can never escape concerns about our dealings (<em>Sorge</em>), which originates from our finitude, but we frequently attempt to deny them.
We distract ourselves from our worries, the primary of which is death, and consequently live <em>in-authentically</em>.
To live <em>authentically</em> means not to “live as you truly are” but to live with the <em>certainty of the end of all possiblities</em> on your side.<br />
Death is not just an endpoint but a companion—a reminder that gives our life meaning and let’s us <em>care</em>.
Our relationship with technological tools, techniques, and devices can aid a distraction, diverting us from our fundamental experience and enticing us into a false sense of security.
This can be dangerous if it impedes the lived awareness of our ultimate existence</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>as beings in trouble in a world of uncertainty.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>We become accustomed to the internet, smartphones, social media, platform economies, and the endless repetition of trivialities.
As individuals, we can often feel powerless in the face of new technologies, and occasionally experience a lack of depth provided by the scattered and dissected elements of our existence.
The <em>essence of technology</em> deprives us of experiencing nearness because to truly experience it, we must encounter things in their truth.
And no matter how deeply we believe that science will allow us to engage with reality in its actuality, science only provides us with representations of things.
It only ever encounters that which its manner of representation has previously admitted as a possible object for itself.</p>
<p>Today the representational character of the digital shapes the physical.
Speaking in Baudrillardian terms: through the colonization of the last frontier—our immediate consciousness—companies are constructing a virtual yet <em>hyper-realistic</em> world that suggests that there is no truth behind it.
This process is evolving so rapidly that meaningful analysis becomes impossible.
Our children will navigate a “meta”-reality.
They won’t believe that the world depicted on their screens and other devices is real—that is not the danger!
I also doubt that they will consciously believe the fake stories of this realm saturated by advertisement.
Instead, they run the risk of becoming cynical; of perceiving the <em>real</em> world as if it is <em>virtual</em>.
Therefore, they may consider everything as a scene to be observed, and all their actions as performances that can be captured and reviewed at any given moment.
This would deny them a life of moments and turn it into a plan for later presentation and peer evaluation.</p>
<p>Kids already sense the digital world in a peculiar, allusive, and meta-like state.
This is why their memes are perpetually ironic, detached, self-referential, and buried beneath twenty layers of irony; the truth is completely dead to them.
They look at a <em>postmodern</em> president and culture and ask: what on earth is this?
They see Coca Cola advertisements that are knowingly winking and smiling at them, and they see through this nonsense.
Advertisers realize this and put yet another layer on top.</p>
<p>But I digress.
Let me go back to the <em>challenging</em> aspect of technology.
It implies that functioning things lead to more functioning things.
Everything is <em>challenged</em> to serve as a systematic resource for technological application, which we subsequently utilize as a resource for further applications, perpetuating a cycle.
For instance, we <em>challenge</em> land to produce coal, considering the land as nothing more than a coal deposit.
The coal is then stockpiled, always ready to unleash the stored solar heat it contains, which is then called upon for warmth, which subsequently is commanded to yield steam whose pressure drives the wheels that sustain a factory’s operations.
The factories themselves are <em>challenged</em> to create tools through which machines are once again put into service and preserved.</p>
<p>Heidegger argues that this chain does not move toward anything that has its own presence, but, instead, “only enters into its <em>circuit</em>”, and is “regulating and securing” natural resources and energies in a never-ending fashion.
Heidegger’s argument is at least interesting.
Given the complexity of modern life, we often lack a clear understanding of how our contributions to the advancement and “improvement” of technology lead to a “better” society.
Beyond meeting basic needs such as housing, food, education, healthcare, social life, and intimacy, it is often difficult to discern how the introduction of new technological gadgets aids this objective.</p>
<p>For example, how does the newest iPhone, with its ability to take more refined pictures, contribute to a “better” society?
The existence of the iPhone and the pressure to create appealing pictures for our profiles prompts many to purchase and use it. This, in turn, increases the demand for memory and computation, subsequently escalating the need for earthly materials. Many would probably be content if that new phone didn’t exist, primarily because they need it only because it exists, not because they truly desire it.</p>
<p>I argue that our understanding of progress being equivalent to technological progress in the form of more and “better” technology is more a question of faith than an envisioned future based on some justification.
Luhmann might point out that <em>technological progress</em> is a <em>value</em> stabilized via communication.
We communicate about the installation of nuclear power plants and buy new gadgets which is a kind of communication.
However, this does not explain why we believe in this <em>value</em>.
I would argue that many people would willingly hit the pause button on all technological progress, at least temporarily.
No one asked for the <em>Metaverse</em>, but we will built it anyways because we are <em>challenged</em> to do so.
Luhmann probabobly would offer a more nuanced explanation: interdependent self-generating social systems which “feed” us into them.
Heidegger’s argument seems quite reductive but it captures my personal feeling of a reality that feels thinner and thinner.</p>
<p>Marxists might argue that my feeling is more related to our socio-economic system.
However, I find it hard to attribute the cause solely to <em>capitalism</em>.
The origin of Mark Fisher’s <em>Capitalist Realism</em> is not so much capitalism but a <em>functional differentiated society</em>.
Of course, capitalism plays a huge role in shaping our social systems.
Heidegger, on the other hand, might attribute capitalism and Luhmann’s <em>functional differentiation</em> to the <em>essence of technology</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A success is that type of consequence that itself remains assigned to the yielding of further consequences. – Martin Heidegger</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>As already mentioned, Heidegger thinks of technology as a <em>mode of seeing</em> where every “seeing” has its necessary blind spots.
He expands on the example of the hammer to illustrate his thoughts about technology:
when using a hammer (a form of technology), you don’t even think about the tool itself; instead, you focus on the nail.
The hammer recedes from your awareness, and you concentrate on the task <em>at hand</em>.
The hammer is <em>ready-to-hand</em> (<em>zuhanden</em>).</p>
<p>Or imagine a more modern example, for instance, the keyboard.
As you become proficient at typing, your primary experience involves the words appearing on the screen rather than the act of pressing the keys.
Furthermore, if you recognize a keyboard you not only see the thing as it appears to you but you also “see” all the possibilities that the thing opens up for you.
The keyboard is, so to say, not only an object but an offer to explore and interact with the world in a certain way.
This phenomenological way of thinking about objects as they appear to us was already formulated by Edmund Husserl, who was Heidegger’s teacher.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This world is not there for me as mere world of facts and affairs, but, with the same immediacy as a world of values, a world of goods, a practical world. Without further effort on my part I find the things before me furnished not only with the qualities that benefit their positive nature, but with value-characters such as beautiful or ugly, agreeable or disagreeable, pleasant or unpleasant, and so forth. Things in their immediacy stand there as objects to be used, the “table” with its “books”, the “glass to drink from”, the “vase”, the “piano” and so forth […] The same considerations apply of course just as well to the men and beasts in my surroundings as to “mere things”. They are my “friends” or my “foes”, my “servants” or “superiors”, “strangers” or “relatives” and so forth. – Edmund Husserl</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Equipment vanishes from our <em>world</em>.
Only if it breaks or fails to perform as expected it introduces itself again as <em>present-at-hand</em> (<em>vorhanden</em>).
Otherwise, it simply serves as a <em>medium</em> through which we experience our world.
For Heidegger, technology withdraws from our attention and becomes transparent.
And if it does, it is all the more genuinely what it is.
In that sense, it needs us to be.
Furthermore, we don’t experience the technology itself, but rather the world through it.
Consequently, technology introduces its own <em>mode of seeing</em>.</p>
<p>When you drive a car proficiently, you develop a sense of the vehicle’s size and whether it can fit through a gap.
Similarly, wearing nail extensions frequently can cause you to forget about them, even though they change how you interact with objects.
Part of the allure of technology is found in the diverse opportunities it provides for unique forms of embodiment.
Philosopher Bruno Latour posits that when technology becomes sufficiently transparent, it becomes an intrinsic part of our self-perception and our experience of the world, thereby giving rise to a new, compound entity.
Evidence from cognitive science supporting this viewpoint is substantial.
Our enjoyment of driving stems from the fact that we transform into “the driver”, a being with speed and power surpassing any land creature.
Likewise, our delight in operating digital devices arises from the sensation of becoming a being that can converse with someone on the opposite side of the globe at a speed comparable to a lightning strike.
Similarly, a person wielding a hammer essentially evolves into a new being, equipped with its own unique way of perceiving the world.
This newly formed being, as a result of the technology’s influence, experiences the world from a distinct perspective and possesses an individualized subjectivity.</p>
<p>Given that technology represents a <em>mode of understanding</em> the world, and acknowledging that our understanding of the world is not entirely self-determined, this perspective seems to envelop us; it is greater than us as individuals.
Heidegger sees the <em>highest danger</em> of technology as its potential to erode our ability to interpret reality profoundly.
The moment we start viewing ourselves as manipulable raw materials, we cease to see ourselves as the ultimate source from which fresh interpretations of the world can spring.
Furthermore, technology can trap us in a specific worldview because as soon as we attempt to devise a new way of interpreting the world, we find ourselves trying to exert power over our inherent <em>will to power</em>.
In essence, we attempt to control our very propensity for control.
Every effort to overcome this <em>will to power</em> only serves to reinforce it.
Consequently, every attempt to break free from this technological mindset only propels us back into it.</p>
