# Technology and Art

>We might be in a collective state of existential crisis, but we are to busy to notice it.

The prevailing Zeitgeist today is technological.
This means that while contemporary societies may critique the application of technology, they rarely question the essence of technology itself. 
The assumption is that humans still wield control over technology and can, therefore, dictate whether it is used for beneficial or harmful purposes.
This understanding of technology as a neutral entity is inherently humanistic; we perceive it as something distinct from us, something we can command and control precisely. 
From a subject-object viewpoint, technology is, by definition, non-human. It can be harnessed for good or evil, for the ugly or the beautiful, and it's our prerogative to decide its usage.

However, this perspective is increasingly being contested by advancements in *artificial intelligence*, particularly in the field of machine learning.
The line between controlling and being controlled is becoming increasingly blurred.

>[...] there is an idea that technology is in its essence something human beings have under their control. In my opinion, that is not possible. Technology is in its essence something that human beings cannot master of their own accord. -- Heidegger

Technology is neither inherently progressive nor repressive. 
We must reimagine technology as something akin to nature, not strictly separate from us. 
It serves as an extension of the human body and mind insofar as it influences our *mode of being*. 
Technology shapes our means of communication and our material realities; it expands realms of possibilities but, simultaneously, shuts out pre-existing lifestyles.

For instance, the advent of cars transformed the planning and construction of cities, subsequently making car ownership mandatory in many regions.
Email revolutionized workplace communication ethics, mandating interaction with emails. 
I consider it a privilege that my generation was among the last to grow up in an internet-free world. 
Today's children face a barrage of distracting spectacles. Their desires and attention are funneled into the profit-driven abyss.

Once well-established, technology assumes a dictatorial role, guiding our modes of communication. 
It influences our everyday life, and if we aim to participate in society, there's no avoiding it. 
We inhabit an age of disruption, where technology evolves so swiftly that it eludes thorough analysis. 
Everyday people are preoccupied, constantly striving to keep up with an endless stream of news feeds vying for their attention. 
It becomes challenging to apply any narrative to their experiences. They can't fully comprehend what's happening; they merely move through their day, moment by moment. 
It's a disorientating state to exist in. 
Time slips away without deep satisfaction; another day sacrificed to Instagram.

The danger lies in never ceasing to hustle. 
We need spaces that facilitate our **real** engagement with technology! 
It's essential to understand how it influences us, how it transforms us, how it can aid us, and how it might harm us.

Following Martin Heidegger, we should draw two distinctions: there are the tools and techniques of modern science, along with all the gadgets created to enhance human comfort, which he refers to as mere technology, and there is the essence of technology, i.e., the structure of the technological world and our way of existing within this world. 
Heidegger argues that if we solely focus on acquiring a more sophisticated understanding of mere technology—mastering tools, instruments, and techniques, even those that indisputably improve our living standards—without understanding the essence of technology, our knowledge will not liberate us but further enslave us.

At this point, I must acknowledge that Heidegger was a Nazi, a fact that should be mentioned when discussing his work. 
Furthermore, it's crucial to examine his philosophy in light of his adherence to Nazism.

>How is it that such a brilliant mind was taken
in by the Nazis? How could Heidegger be so socially irresponsible? It is the
same problem as with Celan: here is a wonderful writer who was a rotten
anti-Semite [...] I have shown Heidegger’s brain with a mushroom-like tumor
growing out of it to make the point. -- Anselm Kiefer

We must consider that Heidegger's concern about global technology initially drove him towards the Nazi party. 
The Nazis were opposed to the two dominant forms of government of that era, communism and democracy, both of which Heidegger associated with global technology. 
Therefore, studying Heidegger is both dangerous and complex.
It demands considerable caution and discernment to appreciate the depth and intricacy of his thought, while remaining cognizant of his association with the Nazis.

Heidegger posits that technology both reveals and conceals, functioning as an open space between paths and a place where reality manifests in a certain light. 
The essence of technology (das Gestell) lies in its mode of revealing and concealing. 
This suggests that technological entities have their unique form of presence, endurance, and interrelationships between parts and wholes. 
They possess their own means of presenting themselves and the world in which they operate -- technology is dominance and control. 
However, the crux of the issue is not in any specific machine, process, or resource. 
Instead, it is challenging (herausfordernd): the manner in which the essence of technology influences our understanding of all matters, and the presence of those matters themselves -- the all-encompassing way we encounter and are encountered by the technological world.

The mode of revealing that predominates throughout modern technology does not manifest as a bringing forth in the sense of poiesis (Gestalt). 
Rather, the revealing that governs modern technology is a challenging (Herausfordern), which makes an unreasonable demand on nature to supply energy that can be extracted and stored as such. 
It's crucial to note that for Heidegger, the challenge predates the unlocking; thus, the essence of technology precedes natural science. 
Modern technology is a distraction from our being-in-the-world (Befindlichkeit), which is always contingent on a mood that Heidegger terms Sorge, signifying fear, worry, or care.

The nature of being-in-the-world is such that we never elude these concerns, but we frequently attempt to deny them. 
We distract ourselves from our worries, the foremost of which is death, and consequently live inauthentically. 
Our relationship with technological tools, techniques, and devices can facilitate this distraction, diverting us from our fundamental experience and luring us into a false sense of security. 
This can pose a danger if it hinders the lived awareness of our ultimate existence:

>beings in trouble in a world of uncertainty.

We become accustomed to the internet, smartphones, social media, platform economies, and the endless repetition of trivialities. As individuals, we can often feel powerless in the face of new technologies, and occasionally experience a lack of depth provided by the scattered and dissected elements of our existence. 
The *essence of technology* deprives us of experiencing nearness because to truly experience it, we must encounter things in their truth. 
No matter how deeply we believe that science will allow us to engage with reality in its actuality, science only provides us with representations of things.

An example from the second lecture illustrates what Heidegger means. 
From a scientific perspective, the distance between a house and the tree in front of it can be measured objectively: it is thirty feet. 
However, in our everyday lives, that distance is not neutral or abstract.
Instead, it is an aspect of our concern with the tree and the house, reflected in the experience of walking, seeing the tree’s shape grow larger as we approach, and feeling an increasing separation from the house as we walk away from it. 
In the scientific account, things become indifferent to our concerns (Sorge); by representing both the distance and the objects as simple mathematical entities or philosophical concepts, we lose our authentic experience of nearness and distance.

Furthermore, functioning things lead to more functioning things. 
And if there is a market (built by channeling desire, i.e., marketing), we will likely have to acclimate to yet another technological fantasy. 
Is it the public that wants to transfer another significant part of reality into a Metaverse? No one asked for it, but we built it because we can, because we are challenged to do so.

I am not advocating for either denial or embracement of technology in general. 
I love technology, and indeed, I would probably be dead without it. 
For most of us, rejecting technology is not an option. 
However, we can cultivate a reflexive understanding that enables us to recognize how reality is constructed by our increasingly technological worldview.

>It certainly is not a matter of condemning the industrial and technological fate of humanity. Rather, it is a case of reinventing this fate. -- Bernard Stiegler

In addition to the crucial distinction between *mere technology* and the *essence of technology*, we must also examine the material reality. 
Who controls the production of mere technology and to what end? 
I believe that digital technology is potent and could help solve many of humanity's problems, from climate change to income distribution, sensor-based agricultural practices, food, education, and the eradication of racialization, gender discrimination, ableism, and classism. 
Digital technology can be incredible, but when decisions about its deployment and use are exclusively in the hands of businesspeople, we encounter a problem.
These individuals implement a perilous form of a technology-driven society with the economy at its absolute center: a type of digital/computational capitalism where algorithms generate money rather than value.

We are no longer operating in a free market. 
We're not in a situation where the people have equal access to tools and technology. 
They no longer maintain control. 
When a young person has an idea, they naturally approach a financier because they perceive it as the only way to get their product developed. 
Developers and entrepreneurs often start with a genuine desire to improve the world. 
They believe their contribution will benefit the world in some way and empower not just them and their investors, but also some industry or consumer base. But then they accept funding from problematic sources, which force them into particular actions. 
Ultimately, at the stock market, business becomes gamified, i.e., companies are no longer focused on their product. 
Their minds are preoccupied with winning; it becomes a contest - Bezos versus *Sergey Brin* versus *Mark Zuckerberg*.

We have to ask:

>Are we programmers, or are we programmed?

The customer of *Meta* is not the young girl using it to forge friendships. 
Rather, it's the company purchasing the girl's *social graph*. 
Who is *Uber*'s customer? It isn't the driver, though it should be. 
Nor is it the passenger, even though it could be. 
Instead, it's the shareholder, the investor. 
*Uber* isn't concerned about creating a robust, sustainable taxi industry.

We must critically analyze the implications of each technology, which means we must abandon the neutral point of view. H
owever, I'm not advocating for a return to some mythical naturalistic past, some elusive authenticity. 
This would only lead to disillusionment because such authenticity was never present to begin with. 
Nature is a splendid beast; it is the real that pursues us; it is who we are. 
The notion of returning to nature -- withdrawing from altering landscapes, bodies, and psychological systems -- lacks basis from a naturalistic ontological perspective. 
There's no reason why we shouldn't challenge its normative power, particularly when constructed power structures masquerade as natural! 
But, heeding Heidegger, we must acknowledge that dominating nature leads to the domination of humanity.

The *essence of technology* is inherently challenging and tends to lead to domination. 
Moreover, specific technological tools are invariably based on certain values and intentions. 
If we opt to utilize a particular technology, we must understand these underlying values and intentions.

Does this technology empower the right people? 
Who is it emancipatory for? How does it alter our ways of thinking, feeling, and communicating? 
Is it beneficial to us? Who is in control of it? What are its intended goals? 
Does it truly function as anticipated? What new possibilities does it create? 
Does it harbor artistic potential? What existing realities does it dismantle?

Moreover, and perhaps most crucially, can we perceive it as more than just a tool? 
Can we appreciate it in its entirety -- as it presents itself to us, without reducing it to its constituent parts, functions, and effects? I am a proponent of a culture of mindful engagement -- a society of informed participants within the sphere of technology. 
A capable society should possess the authority to reject technological progress in favor of cultural advancement.

We must understand how we can be manipulated, what is beneficial for us, and what our needs are. 
For instance, we know that non-virtual social interactions are vital. 
It's soothing and comforting for human beings to make eye contact with others, thereby achieving physical synchronization with another person. 
Today, much of our communication lacks this synchronization. 
This communication is superficial and abstract, leaving us feeling hollow and increasingly fatigued.

>The 21st century is oppressed by a crushing sense of finitude and exhaustion. -- *Mark Fisher*

We exist within a constant churn of emails, calendars, and Zoom meetings, often neglecting the things that truly bring us happiness: engaging in conversations with others, playing with our children, and expressing love. 
Concurrently, there persists an ever-present *fear of missing out*: can I seize this opportunity before it's entirely gone? 
Analyzing *mere technology* through an honest scientific lens is valuable, yet it doesn't address the crux of Heidegger's observations. 
To comprehend the *essence of technology*, we might need to grapple with its and our being-in-the-world and time.

What engenders a degree of optimism in me is the younger generation.
Despite the rising suicide rates, arguably linked to social media usage, I've noticed a trend of increased caution towards technology among some individuals. 
Young people seem to employ technology more judiciously, largely because they're less enthralled by it. 
They appear to comprehend that these massive tech companies are not invested in enhancing their lives, but rather in leveraging them as tools.

I am of the belief that technology is invariably both destructive and creative. 
It disrupts existing spaces while simultaneously forging new ones. 
Art, however, has the capacity to accentuate the open relationship between 'earth' (rock and stone, flood and famine, birth and death, tools and technology) and the *world* (the cultural and historical horizon that both reveals and conceals the earth). 
Art can, so to speak, unify them. Unlike technology, artistic works offer numerous paths and are more open in their *revealing*. 
An artwork opens up pathways, relationships, and possibilities. 
Art can elucidate the meaning of technology, enabling us to develop an open relationship with it. 
For instance, a piece of art can expose our uncertainty about whether technology can be disregarded, or whether it embodies a seductive cosmic force that we're incapable of resisting.

We are obliged to perpetually question the nature of technology. 
I believe it's not a matter of outright resistance or unconditional acceptance, but rather of informed ambivalence, deliberate retreat, and vigilant anticipation. 
As such, the artist's duty is to disclose and explore this process. 
She is the one who crafts aesthetic symbols, setting the stage for a possible future. 
The approach should involve neither prejudice nor antagonism, but rather sincere engagement with technology and its creators. 
After all, the artifacts of our past aren't natural occurrences but are crafted by people. Yet, what has transpired and what will occur are guided by the horizon of possibility, which is 'enframed' (gestellt) by technology and unveiled by artistic works.

Our thought process should acknowledge the challenge posed by technology. 
We must resist our automatic acceptance of the challenge and the current state of "progress", as it tends to instill a sense of powerlessness towards instigating change. 
There is neither room for bittersweet melancholy nor illusions that minor local changes will be adequate.

Echoing the words of Mark Fisher: I'm not apprehensive about a zombie apocalypse; rather, my concern lies in the ease with which people can envisage such an apocalypse, in contrast to visualizing life a decade or two hence. 
My worry is that we may have already conceded defeat, that we lack the imagination and bravery to adopt different strategies, and that we might succumb to reflexive responses and seemingly easy but unrealistic solutions.

Digital technology plays a critical role in inducing our complacency and inertia, even as we stare into the impending abyss. 
Therefore, let's engage with it proactively. Let's cultivate a critical perspective. 
Let's counteract its overbearing influence. Let's compose a new anthem of technological empowerment for people across the globe. 
Let's reimagine our *cyberculture*. 
Art could potentially help liberate us from technology's grasp by charting a new path, a new consciousness of our existence.

>Digital is not here to put an end to anything.
>Rather it is here to expand all things, to combine and to make more things attainable.
>For the artist, it is the edgiest work of all; the biggest, most exciting challenge in a long history of the synthesis between technology and hand and mind and heart. -- *J.D. Jarvis*

Ultimately, it may be the 'energy of earth' that unveils a potential earth-world relationship. 
This could be Heidegger's god, for whom we are waiting and preparing.

>Philosophy will not be able to bring about a direct change of the present state of the world. This is true not only of philosophy but of all merely human meditations and endeavors. Only a god can still save us. I think the only possibility of salvation left to us is to prepare readiness, through thinking and poetry, for the appearance of the god or for the absence of the god during the decline; so that we do not, simply put, die meaningless deaths, but that when we decline, we decline in the face of the absent god. -- Heidegger, Spiegel inverview in 1966
