# Music Theory

>I was lucky enough to be shown a Penderecki score and played polymorphia by a tutor. It was just really exciting. I didn't know you are allowed to do that. I didn't know you could be that free and you can just think of 48 musicians as being able to do anything. -- *Jonny Greenwood*

Faced with the need to communicate, humans developed languages, i.e., vowel and consonant sounds and the astonishing capability to recognize them.
It seems that consequently, our ears developed into highly sophisticated analyzers of frequency, loudness, harmony, and dissonance because, with languages, came the need to acknowledge slight differences.
Differentiation is a necessary condition to build an entity and its environment, i.e., what we can differentiate from the entity.
It reduces complexity to a point at which reality emerges -- without complexity reduction, reality would be an unstructured muddy see of noise.
Differentiation makes us but also disconnects us, a contrast we always struggle with and for which we employ music to overcome it, at least for a moment. 

Our hearing capabilities enable us to enjoy the art of music.
They enable us to recognize patterns of compression and rarefaction of molecules; 
a physical process that can be mathematically represented by the relation of numbers.
Music arises if there are multiple such relationships.
At its core, music is about the relation of numbers, i.e., *ratios*, related to other numbers, i.e., *intervals*.

*Music theory* is the science of these relationships in relation to the cultural, social, and emotional interpreting creature that lived during different centuries at different places.
It is the study of theoretical aspects as well as practices and possibilities of music and its notation in a cultural and historical context.
In its essence, it studies the cognition and perception of human beings; 
our cognition and perception;

Music theory developed historically a long time ago and has matured since then.
Consequently, there are numerous terms, often for the same thing, which makes it hard to start diving into it.
But to communicate ideas and concepts, the elaborate terminology is a valuable bridge in the same way mathematical notations allow us to convey ideas quickly and ambiguously.
To understand the literature and communicate effectively, one must learn the music theory terminology.

However, this does not mean that we have to adapt techniques or rules that emerged from the study of music.
It is easy to see that contrains can be helpful to explore the space of possibilities but innovation often relys on breaking out of the ordinary.
There is no hard limit, nothing is forbidden, everything is permitted.
A good example to observe the dissolution and evolution of musical rules is Western music tradition*.
Classical as well as popular music is guided by this tradition but we sometimes forget that these rules constrain us to only one specific set of our vast space of possibilities.
Importantly, these rules of generating well-received music changed over the centuries.
They tend to open up from a narrow perspective starting from *Pythagoreanism* (600 BC) to the *Gregorian mode* (early middle ages until 1600), the *major-minor-tonality* (1700-1900), *Schoneberg's* *atonality* and *serialism* (1900-1940) and *Penderecki's* experimentals compositions that are radical explorations of timbre.

In summary, music theory provides us with terminology to effectively convey and absorb musical ideas and concepts.
It provides knowledge about the relation of numbers and how these relations may affect the listener.
But it can also be limiting if taken too literally.
For example, it has the musician and its (analog) instrument in mind.
Therefore, until recently, its literature does not provide us with musical aspects that can not be realized by musicians that are constrained by their physical as well as mental ability to play an instrument.
Consequently, music theory is a valuable subject to grasp, but it should never be taken as definitive truth.
