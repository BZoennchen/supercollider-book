# Live Coding

*Live coding* or *conversational programming*, *on-the-fly-programming*, *interactive programming* or *just in time programming* is a paradigm that includes the programming activity in the program's operation.
A program is not taken as a tool that is made first to be productive later, but instead as a dynamic construction process of description and conversation.
Writing code becomes an integral part of musical or experimental practice. 

*Interactive programming* currently has its renaissance in the area of *scientific computing*, *data science* and *machine learning*.
Notebooks such as *Jupyter notebooks* support the interaction between programmers and machines.
For example, data scientists visualize data via code evaluation of a so called notebook cell.
Based on the result they may decide what code they wanna write next.
However, compared to musical arrangements there is a key difference:
The cycle of communication between these two partys result in a final product because we rarely transform useful code into something else.
Instead, the final notebook is a well documented depiction of our data analysis.

In the context of music, **the process is the product**.
We transform code that is an essential part of a composition.
It vanishes into nothingness -- thats the beauty.
