# Introduction

I discovered the world of algorithmic composition and sound design using code this year (2021)!
It all started when I watched an enthusiastic and really motivating presentation about [Sonic Pi](https://github.com/sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi) by Sam Aaron.
I was immediately hooked!

However, soon after experimenting with Sonic Pi, I wanted to write my own synth for which it is not suitable.
I wanted to learn more about actual algorithmic composition and sound design, doing what I may be best at: coding.
Along the way I discovered [TidalCycle](https://github.com/tidalcycles/Tidal), [FoxDot](https://foxdot.org/) and, of course, [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/).

Being creative by producing sound was the essential puzzle piece I was always looking for -- a strong connection between computer science and art.

## Why Writing a Book?

I’m very excited and want to learn more about the topic. 
This book is my attempt to do so, nothing more and nothing less (for now at least).
To really understand something, one has to pass through a grueling learning process.
One such strategy that works for me is called the Feynman learning technique:

1. Pretend to teach a concept you want to learn about to a student in the sixth grade.
2. Identify gaps in your explanation. Go back to the source material to understand it better.
3. Organize and simplify.
4. Transmit (optional).

This book is my attempt to follow Feynman's technique imperfectly.
Maybe, in the end, someone else will find some useful ideas in this book.
At the moment, I focus on [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/). 

## Source Code

The source code of the Jupyter-Book can be found here: [GitHub](https://github.com/BZoennchen/supercollider-book).

The book is currently published using [GitHub-Pages](https://bzoennchen.github.io/supercollider-book/intro.html).

## The Nature of an Online-Book

I experiment with SuperCollider and other tools and I write this book all in my spare time. 
It is a hobby. 
Therefore, I will develop and update it over time.
It is only a skeleton at its current state, and I will add new chapters and edit old ones. 
Therefore, do not expect anything professional.

In the future, you might be interested in extending the book with your content. 
Maybe this project will become a community effort to make SuperCollider, sound design, other tools and techniques more accessible.

Another thing I am looking forward to is combining the book with a Jupyter-Kernel for SuperCollider such that the book becomes interactive.

## Silent Contributors

I want to emphasize that this book is a mixture of my discoveries filtered and altered by my mind.
The creators of my discoveries and the content of the materials I studied are silent contributors.
Without the already existing material, I would not be able to learn SuperCollider or sound design in general. 

A special thank goes to [Eli Fieldsteel](https://www.elifieldsteel.com/), who provides multiple excellent courses for [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) openly and for free via his [YouTube-Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/elifieldsteel).
