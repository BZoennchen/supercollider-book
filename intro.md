# Introduction

>What, if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: 'This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more' [...] Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: 'You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine. -- Nietzsche

## Why it Matters -- A Romantic Argument

In its early state, *Cyberculture* promised a new kind of creative freedom, an innovative age of anarchistic collaboration and collective expressions;
a last stand against the *Last Man*, a Nietzschian might say.
However, that fruitful dream was quickly sold.
While visionaries kept dreaming, the capital was already in place to establish a new market.
Instead of a democratic digital space, *cyberspace* was altered by the rules of the old exploitative business models we naively believed we could escape from.
I was too young to witness this downfall firsthand and could only dive into leftover artifacts, such as the *Gaming Culture* which nowadays has mostly dissolved into a large market as well.

Looking at New York, around 1975, one can observe that many radical left-wing artists resigned by retreating from politics and collective activism to a state of cool and ironic detachment.
They were in a mood of disillusion and did no longer try to change the decaying city of New York – they just experienced it. Artists fled into a hyper-individualistic dream world.
Instead of changing material realities, i.e., what is outside, they believed they should try to change what was inside people’s heads.
And the way to do that was through self-expression and not collective action. But by doing so, they became alienating for those who wanted to act collectively.
Furthermore, they and the people that experienced their art were beginning to lose touch with the reality of power.

>It was the mood of the era, and the revolution was deferred indefinitely.
And while we were dozing, the money crept in.

Politicians also resigned from politics, letting the financial sector overtake many parts of government management.
The system changed from a system of negotiations between different peers to the control system of the market in which negotiations were superfluous.
The old idea of using politics to change the world was replaced by the new idea that you could run the world as a stable system.

Today we realize that this tech explosion brought us an even higher degree of monetarization and commercialization.
Now our dreams, feelings, moments, culture, and intimacy are open for sale.
Andrew Dominik articulates this uncanny realization through his character Jackie in *Killing Them Softly*:

>I'm living in America, and in America, you're on your own. America's not a country. It's just a business. Now fucking pay me.

Of course, this dog-eat-dog mentality was successfully exported a long time ago, and many firmly believe it is an essential human characteristic.

Grown from a world of money making commodities, art can never be seen as innocent.
Even if its creators could deprive themselves of that world entirely, the audience can not.
Money, as a stand-in for divine-like comparability, poisons art.
And capitalism drives us into a cycle of endless consumption and repetitive cloning.
Most of us can no longer create, can no longer bring out what's inside but consume what's in front.
Sure, there might be some short period in which something genuinely creative can emerge.
Still, soon after, its singularity will be destroyed by its assimilation into a sellable, thus quantifiable product.
Money is indifferent; that's the beauty and horror of it.

In that sense, it is the opposite of life itself which is all about differentiation -- bodies, cells, planets, cultures, and their environment.
Our *being there* (*Dasein*) can not be dissected, and it can not be understood by science because any attempt can only happen while being there;
It is like time for which any articulation of what it is can only happen in time.
We need time to explain time, and we need *Dasein* to grasp *Dasein*.
Science has to be blind to the *Dasein*; it has to look at specifics with a particular perspective.

Today many people live in a *Symbolic Misery* because the mystical aspect of their life has no more place in a *Control Society*.
They can choose, but only from a set of pretty similar possibilities.
Nothing radical is in sight.
The horizon of what is sensible has narrowed down.
We are self-regulatory and self-controlling;
there is no longer the need to point guns at our heads.
Many of us feel empty, haunted by *Lost Futures* while the *Rage Against the Machine* seems now unimaginable.

Is it time to give up?
Let it play out and see where we land?
We could try to find the last joy in *Hedonic Nihilism*, but that seems just not enough.
However, as long there is life, there is a *Will to Live*.
As long there is *Dasein* there is something mystical.
It is our last stand against complete assimilation, an indestructible sparkle of hope.

Even if we lack an alternative to the money-making machine and seemingly silently accept this "fact", a reinvigorated *cyberculture* might act as a reminder that, despite *Mark Fisher's* declaration, we can still revolt against *Capitalist Realism*.
The story politicians tell the everyday person no longer reflects the reality they live in.
Reality and our model of reality no longer fit together.
This discrepancy triggers a strange feeling.
We function daily as we only know to function, but deep down, we know that it makes no sense.
Our state of mind is similar to that of the people of the collapsing *Soviet Union*.
Their system was broken long before it collapsed, and everyone knew it, but at the same time, everyone acted like everything was working as intended because no one could imagine it any other way.
We, too, know that what our leaders say is fiction, but we also act as if it is real.

Is brutal exploitation of one another the only way to build and keep a society for some worth living in?
In the face of climate, ecological and economic disasters, we can no longer assume that endless material growth is a feasible economic strategy.
It never was, but now it is clear that it is no longer feasible in the short run -- the stability of the current system is just a fantasy.
However, we still act as if it is feasible.
Like the people of the late *Soviet Union*, we are acting as if everything is going according to plan even though the climate catastrophe is realistically unavoidable.
From this perspective, *Capitalist Realism* is not *The End of History* but a sign of a failing system that is on the brink of collapse.

One very old alternative that is getting more and more traction, is fascism.
By telling the tales of genetic inferiority, fascism is one way to justify inequality and the annihilation of billions of people, facing the fact that endless material growth is impossible and many areas will become uninhabitable.
Right-wing forces are on the rise.
They can give the people, beaten down and affected by their *Symbolic Misery*, some short term relief.
They can give easy answers to very complex questions.
However, these forces act like a drug: they kick in, but soon after, their effect fades away, and you need an ever higher dose to get the same impact.
Therefore, I stand by Carl Sagan and hope their violent and aggressive story is not enough.

>The old appeals to racial, sexual, and religious chauvinism and to rabid nationalist fervor are beginning not to work.
A new consciousness is developing which sees the Earth as a single organism and recognizes that an organism at war with itself is doomed. We are one planet. -- Carl Sagan

The phenomenon of someone like Trump might signify our desperate desire to find a story that makes sense of our realities.
People are thirsty.
There may never be a better time for a good story teller.
If there is only darkness at the horizon, lighting a candle can move the world.
And art can be a place to start constructing or contributing to a new ideal to strive towards.

Disaster will arrive in our lifetime, but we still shall live our lives in such a way that we welcome the demon forcing us to live it over and over again because we once experienced a moment of unimaginable, undescribable, and non-reproducible quality and beauty.
If we can not live in dignity, we might learn the art of dying.
This pessimistic viewpoint sounds bleak.
But I think it is important to accept the possibility of this reality and to come to peace with it.
Not to flee reality but instead to be in it, more than ever, and to take on that fight -- to bring dignity and love into a dying world.

Even though computers and networks have turned on many people, these technologies have the potential to emancipate the citizen of our planet by being a tool to build genuine connections.
A musical performance constructs a timely space where one can experience such collective connections.
Therefore, to me, the *community of algorithmic composing* and *live coding* is a project to resist the looming assimilation and to find joy in a time of misery and despair;
not because it is a *counter-culture* defined by its negation but because its community strides towards affirming differences of the living being while acting collectively.
I hope that someday this little project will strengthen the effort.

## How I Started

I discovered the world of algorithmic composition and sound design using code in late 2021.
It all started when I watched an energetic and really motivated Sam Aaron presenting his [Sonic Pi](https://github.com/sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi).
I was immediately hooked, especially given the context: educational live programming for kids!

I started experimenting with Sonic Pi.
However, soon after playing around with it, I wanted to write my own synths for which it is unsuitable.
Sonic Pi is perfectly appropriate for sequencing your synth and samples but not so much for creating new exciting instruments.
You create your synth and samples beforehand and then use Sonic Pi to play with them.

I digged deeper and discovered other interesting tools such as [TidalCycle](https://github.com/tidalcycles/Tidal), [FoxDot](https://foxdot.org/) and, of course, [SuperCollider (SC)](https://supercollider.github.io/).
I am surprised that I never heard about SC before, even if it matured a long time ago, and there seems to be no natural alternative.
Compared to Sonic Pi, SuperCollider has a much steeper learning curve.
The language has some awful-looking syntax; it is less accessible, but at the same time, SuperCollider is much more extensible and powerful.

I fell in love with SC.
The language offers fascinating concepts that keep you thinking about signal-flow processing.
SC supports features well known in modern languages, such as ``Python``, and rather old languages.
The IDE feels pretty modern and supportive.
The documentation is decent, and the community is healthy.
SC is a powerhouse for discovering new exciting sounds.
It can be a driving force for learning sound design on a deep level.

It is time for me to learn more about *algorithmic compositions* and *sound design*.
What better way to get started than doing what I may be best at: coding.
Being creative by producing sound was the essential puzzle I was always looking for -- a strong connection between computer science and art.

## Who is Speaking?

>One’s stories persuade one’s audience that one is a particular kind of person. When one is one’s own audience, the telling amounts to having a self. -- *Leslie Ervine*, Even Better Than the Real Thing

Who am I?
Any description of oneself is doomed because it is a disection of the whole.
It is a typical modern thing to do: categorization.
It is insufficient and in its worst manifestations, discriminatory.
So take this with a grain of salt.
I can only feed your biased imagination.

From the bottom of my heart, I am a computer scientist.
But I may have to clarify my interpretation of the term.
I mean computer scientist in the sense of studying different aspects of computation:

+ **information:** what is information, and how can we create, manipulate and interpret it?
+ **computation:** what is computable, and what do we mean by that?
+ **formal methods:** what can we express, and what do we need to express it?
+ **algorithms** and **data structures:** what can we build?

After school, I did practical training as a software developer.
I worked for four years in the industry.
Then, in desperation, I finished an additional year in school and finally started studying computer science.
I finished my Bachelor's degree in 2013, my Master's in 2017, and my Ph.D. in 2021.
In my Ph.D. thesis, I analyzed different microscopic simulation models for pedestrian streams and developed algorithms to simulate many pedestrians in a large area faster than in real-time.
During my time as a Ph.D. candidate, I enjoyed teaching.
Today, I am a software developer for University that focuses on tools to support our education.
Furthermore, I try to influence the content as well as the structure of our lectures in a positive way.

For other computer scientists interested in the topic of this book, it might be valuable to know which programming experience I had at the time of writing it.
I am very experienced in ``Java``.
Furthermore, I developed an introductory course for ``Python``.
I am also familiar with ``JavaScript``, ``PHP``, ``Scala``, and ``Go``.
Furthermore, I can read and understand ``C\C++`` code, but I am not very experienced in it.
I am familiar with GPU programming using ``OpenCL``.
Currently, I am trying to learn some ``Rust``.

I have no music theory education and do not play an instrument.
So this is a solid contrast to other great contributors, such as [Eli Fieldsteel](https://www.elifieldsteel.com/).
However, I am a big music lover, and I have always wanted to make my own music and never thought programming could lead me to this goal.

I am neither a professional musician nor a "professional" artist.
However, I strongly believe that every human being is capable of creating a whole universe of meaning.
We are storytellers thrown (*geworfen*) into a world that changes depending on our mood.
We can not change our being (*Dasein*), but we can choose how we want to deal with it.
Do we reject our surroundings, becoming alienated in the process?
Do we revolt against our fundamental condition of confusion?
Do we make the place where we live our home?

Music gives me peace.
It gracefully touches my soul.
It reminds me that something in this world expresses *The Concrete*.
Something that escapes our calculating minds; something unexplainable.
Music sets me free.
Coding sets me free.
Thus, for me, coding music is the ultimate freedom.

## Notes on Technology

>We might be in a collective state of existential crisis, but we are to busy to notice it.

In my opinion, technology should not be trusted naively.
Technology is neither inherently good nor bad -- it can be used for the good, the bad, the ugly, and the beautiful.
In addition, it is neither inherently progressive nor repressive.
We must rethink technology as something that, like nature, is not strictly separated from us.
Technology shapes our way of communication and our material realities; it opens up spaces of possibilities but, at the same time, closes the door to preexisting ways of life.

For example, the introduction of cars influenced how we plan and build cities and, consequently, possessing a car became mandatory in many areas.
Email changed our communication ethics at the workplace; it made the interaction with emails mandatory.
I see it as a privilege that my generation was one of the last growing up in an internet-free world.
Today, children are confronted with a world of spectacle distractions.
Their desires and their attention is channeled into the profit making fungus.

Massively widespread technology has this dictating ability -- once established, it dictates our way of communication.
It shapes our mundane life, and if we want to live within society, we can not escape it.
We live in an *age of disruption* where technology escapes any deep analysis because it evolves faster than we can blink.
Every-day people are busy.
They are constantly trying to keep up with all the news feeds poking at them, and it becomes hard to apply any narrative to their experiences.
They do not know what is going on.
They are just moving through their day, moment to moment.
It is a disorienting place to be.
Time slips away without any deep satisfaction; another day went to *Instagram*.

The danger is never to stop hustling.
We need spaces that help us not to escape but to **really** engage with technology!
To understand how it affects us, how it changes us, how it can help us and how it might destroy us.

We get used to the internet, smartphones, social media, and other platform economies, and endless repetition of the trivial.
As an individual, we seem powerless concerning new technologies.
If there is a market (built buy the creation of desire, i.e., marketing), we most certainly have to get used to yet another technological phantasy.
Is it *The Public* that wants to transfer another big chunk of reality into a *Metaverse*;
a virtual world based on a business ontology and governed by a corporate dictatorship?

I neither advocate for the denial nor for embracing technology in general.
I love technology.

>It certainly is not a matter of condemning the industrial and technological fate of humanity. Rather, it is a case of reinventing this fate. -- *Bernard Stiegler*

I think digital technology is powerful and could likely solve the majority of humanities problems; 
from climate change to income distribution, sensor-based agricultural practice, food, education and the abolishment of racialization, gender discrimination, ableism and classism.
Digital technology can be amazing, but when all decisions about how to deploy and use it are in the hands of business people, then we have a problem.
These people implement a hazardous form of technological-driven society with the economy at its absolute center: a form of *digital / computational capitalism* where algorithms produce money instead of value.

We are no longer in a free market.
We are not in a place where the people have the same access to tools and technology.
They are no longer the masters.
When a young person has an idea, they automatically go to a money person because they think that is the only way to get their product developed.
Developers and entrepreneurs often start with a genuine belief to make the world a better place.
They believe their contribution will help the world in some way and be empowering, not just to them and their investors, but to some industry or consumer base.
But then they take money from problematic angles forcing them into specific actions.
At the stock market, business becomes gamified, i.e., companies are no longer concerned about their product.
Their mind is occupied with winning; 
*Bezos* versus *Sergey Brin* versus *Mark Zuckerberg*.

We have to ask:

>Are we programmers, or are we programmed?

*Meta's* customer is not the little girl using it to make friends.
No, it is the company that is buying the little girl's *social graph*.
Who is *Uber's* customer?
It is not the driver that it should be.
It is not the passenger, which it could be.
It is the shareholder, the investor.
*Uber* does not care about creating a decent, sustainable taxi industry.

We must critically analyze what each technology does, implying that we disregard the *neutral point of view*.
However, I do not advocate for returning to some naturalistic past, i.e., some lost authenticity.
It would bring only disappointment because such authenticity was never there in the first place.
Nature is a beautiful beast; it is the real that hunts us; it is us.
*Going back to nature* in the sense that we withdraw from working on landscapes, bodies and psychic systems are unfounded from a naturalistic ontological perspective.
There is no reason why we should not challenge its normative power, especially if constructed power structures are disguised as *natural*!

While technology is not inherently good or bad, it can never be neutral.
It is always based on some value and intention, and if we use a particular technology, we have to know what these values and intentions are.
Does this technology empower the right people?
Is it emancipatory?
How does it change our way of thinking, feeling, and communicating?
Is it helpful for us?
Who is controlling it?
What does it intend to accomplish?
Does it really work as intended?
What spaces does it open up?
Does it offer artistic potential?
What realities does it destroy?
I advocate for a culture of conscious engagement -- a society of aware agents within the realm of technology.
A potent society should have the power to reject technological advances in favor of cultural progress.

To understand technology, we have to understand ourselves.
We have to know how we can be manipulated, what is good for us, and what we need.
For example, we know that non-virtual social interactions are important.
It is calming and reassuring for human organisms to look into someone else's eyes, so to literally move into sync with another person.
Today we have so much communication without synchronization.
The communication is shallow and abstract.
We end up feeling empty and more exhausted.

>The 21st century is oppressed by a crushing sense of finitude and exhaustion. -- *Mark Fisher*

We live between emails, calendars, and *Zoom*-Meetings, missing out on the things that really make us happy: talking to other people, playing with our kids, and giving love to others.
At the same time, there is always a *fear of missing out*:
Can I get in on this thing before it is completely gone?

What makes me optimistic about our use of technology are young people.
Even though we have an increase in suicide rates, probably due to the use of social media, I also observe more caution towards technology.
Young people seem to use technology much more appropriately because they are less fascinated by it.
They seem to understand that these big tech companies are not interested in improving their lives but in using them as vehicles.

I believe technology is always destructive as well as creative.
It disrupts existing spaces and opens up new ones. 
The artist's responsibility is to reveal and explore this process.
She is the one who create aesthetic symbols -- a horizon of a possible future.
Neither being prejudiced nor playing the devil's advocate but engaging with technology and its masters honestly.
The artifacts of our past are not given circumstances of nature but are invented by people.
We must disregard our automatic acceptance of how things are because it leads to a sense of helplessness about changing anything.
There is neither time for the bitter sweet melancholia nor the illusion that small local changes suffice.
Echoing the words of *Mark Fisher*: I am not worried about a zombie apocalypse, but I am worried that it is easier for people to imagine a zombie apocalypse than to visualize what life will be like in 10 or 20 years from now.
I am concerned that we have already given up, that we lack the imagination and courage to engage in the way that we really should be, and we will resort to reactions and seemingly easy but unreal solutions.

The digital is a critical factor in driving our pacification while we are looking into the abyss right in front of us.
So let us engage with it; let us be critical; let us fight back; let us sing a new song of technological empowerment of the people all around the world; let us reimagine our *cyberculture*.

>Digital is not here to put an end to anything.
Rather it is here to expand all things, to combine and to make more things attainable.
For the artist, it is the edgiest work of all; the biggest, most exciting challenge in a long history of the synthesis between technology and hand and mind and heart. -- *J.D. Jarvis*

## Why Writing an Online-Book?

I am very excited!
I want to learn more about the *algorithmic composition*. 
This book is my attempt to do so; nothing more and nothing less (for now at least).
To understand something, one has to pass through a grueling learning process.
One such strategy that works for me is called *the Feynman learning technique*.
It consists of the following steps:

1. pretend to teach a concept you want to learn about to a student in the sixth grade
2. identify gaps in your explanation. Go back to the source material to understand it better
3. organize and simplify
4. transmit (optional)

This book is my attempt to follow *Feynman's technique* imperfectly.
In the end, someone else might find valuable ideas in this book.
Currently, I focus solely on [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) and *sound design*. 

I experiment with SuperCollider and other tools and write this book in my spare time. 
It is a hobby. 
Therefore, I will develop and update it over time.
In its current state it is only a skeleton, and I will add new chapters and edit old ones. 
Therefore, do not expect anything professional.

In the future, you might be interested in extending the book with your content. 
Maybe this project will become a community effort to make SuperCollider, sound design, and other tools and techniques more accessible.

Another thing I am looking forward to is combining the book with a Jupyter-Kernel for SuperCollider such that the book becomes interactive.

The source code of the Jupyter-Book can be found inside one of [GitHub](https://github.com/BZoennchen/supercollider-book) repositories.
The book is currently published using [GitHub-Pages](https://bzoennchen.github.io/supercollider-book/intro.html).

## Silent Contributors

I want to emphasize that this book is a mixture of my discoveries filtered and altered by my mind.
The creators of my discoveries and the content of the materials I studied are silent contributors.
Without the already existing material, I would not be able to learn either SuperCollider or sound design. 

A special thank goes to [Eli Fieldsteel](https://www.elifieldsteel.com/), who provides multiple excellent courses for [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) openly and for free via his [YouTube-Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/elifieldsteel).
