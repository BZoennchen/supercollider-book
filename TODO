Even though computers and networks have turned on many people, these technologies have the potential to emancipate the citizen of our planet by being a tool to build genuine connections.
A musical performance constructs a timely space where one can experience collective connections.
Computer music slipped out of commercialization, for this alone it is interesting.
It is like being back in 1990, remembering the *fever dream* which might be the first step to finally realize it.
Therefore, to me, the *community of algorithmic composing* and *live coding* is a project to resist the looming assimilation and to find joy in a time of misery and despair because its community strides towards affirming differences of the living being while acting collectively and inclusive.
I hope that someday this little project will strengthen the effort.
