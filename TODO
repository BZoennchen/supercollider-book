Even though computers and networks have turned on many people, these technologies have the potential to emancipate the citizen of our planet by being a tool to build genuine connections.
A musical performance constructs a timely space where one can experience collective connections.
Computer music slipped out of commercialization, for this alone it is interesting.
It is like being back in 1990, remembering the *fever dream* which might be the first step to finally realize it.
Therefore, to me, the *community of algorithmic composing* and *live coding* is a project to resist the looming assimilation and to find joy in a time of misery and despair because its community strides towards affirming differences of the living being while acting collectively and inclusive.
I hope that someday this little project will strengthen the effort.

 One institution where this erosion of diverse and critical thought can be observed is the university, especially in Europe. 
The Bologna process has standardized and commodified the education system. 
Students are permitted to think, but only so far as it leads to "productivity" in an economic sense -- to reproduce and comply with an unquestioned system of economic exploitation. 
More often than not, universities today teach emotionally detached students to memorize specific rules so they can apply them in their next exam to earn good grades.
It's alarming that one of the most common questions from first-semester students is: what will the exam look like? 
Is this topic relevant for the exam? 
Students demand a checklist of actions guaranteed to earn them an A. 
If possible, they will exploit the system to achieve this goal. 
Many students are not captivated by the vast playground of reality. 
Their interest lies not in the experience of learning and understanding, but in the end product -- the certificate that grants access to well-paying jobs. 
And let's not forget that the teachers of tomorrow are the students of today.

This is not to blame the students. 
They are merely players in a control system that demands their compliance. 
We have ceased to punish. 
Instead, the network of machines now filters and channels the stream of desires and possibilities. 
It seems impossible to deviate from this school-like system since the new generation of professors was nurtured within it. 
Today, education equates to consumption.

However, it would be unjust to claim that this path hasn't been met with substantial critique and calls for adjustment. 
There is, indeed, mounting pressure, but the resultant changes remain to be seen. 
When the collective's wellbeing relies on the altruism of unelected individuals to fund their research and education plans, democracy is either under threat or merely an illusion.




## Martin Heidegger

Following Martin Heidegger's perspective, this is no longer the case. 
He distinguishes two aspects: the tools and techniques of modern science, along with all the devices created to enhance human comfort, which he refers to as *mere technology*, and the *essence of technology* (*Gestell*), i.e., the structure of the technological world and our *mode of existence* within it. 
To consider technology *essentially* is to see it as an event to which we belong: the structuring, ordering, and requisitioning of everything around us, and of ourselves.
Heidegger argues that if we focus solely on acquiring a more sophisticated understanding of *mere technology*---mastering tools, instruments, and techniques, even those that indisputably improve our living standards---without understanding the *essence of technology*, our knowledge will not liberate us but further entrap us.

In his seminal book, *Being and Time* {cite}`heidegger:1927`, Heidegger audaciously posited that Western philosophy, dating back to Plato, had neglected or bypassed the fundamental question of what it truly means for something *to be*---to exist for us before any philosophical or scientific examination. 
Throughout his writings, he attempted to elucidate how Western civilization, following the advent of Greek philosophy, had been steadily moving towards *nihilism*. 
He was of the view that the contemporary cultural and intellectual crisis---our descent into nihilism---was inextricably tied to this *oblivion of being*. 
Only a renaissance of being and the sphere in which it is revealed might rescue *modern* humanity.
Some people regard him as the most inventive and influential thinker of his time, while others dismiss him as an obfuscator and an impostor. 

It is imperative at this point to recognize that Heidegger was a Nazi, an aspect that should be prominently emphasized while discussing his contributions.
It is essential to analyze his philosophy within the backdrop of his association with Nazism.
Heidegger’s thought always was and remained *illiberal*, tending to encompass all matters, philosophy and politics among them, in a single perspective, ignoring the freedom of most people to act independently.
But if, as Heidegger hoped, his works are to help us understand the challenges technology presents, we must study him both carefully and cautiously---carefully, to appreciate the depth and complexity of his thought, and cautiously, in light of his association with the Nazis.

>How is it that such a brilliant mind was taken
in by the Nazis? How could Heidegger be so socially irresponsible? It is the
same problem as with Celan: here is a wonderful writer who was a rotten
anti-Semite [...] I have shown Heidegger’s brain with a mushroom-like tumor
growing out of it to make the point. -- Anselm Kiefer

In his later writings on technology {cite}`heidegger:1954`, which mainly concern us in this section, Heidegger draws attention to technology’s place in bringing about our decline by constricting our experience of things as they are. 
He argues that we now view nature, and increasingly human beings too, only technologically---that is, we see nature and people only as raw material for technical operations.
We might escape this bondage, Heidegger argues, not by rejecting technology, but by perceiving its danger.

We need to bear in mind that Heidegger's concerns about global technology initially drew him towards the Nazi party. 
The Nazis stood in opposition to the two prevailing forms of governance during that period---communism and democracy---which Heidegger associated with global technology. 
Hence, studying Heidegger is both hazardous and intricate. 
It requires great caution and discernment to comprehend the depth and complexity of his thought, all while being acutely aware of his affiliation with the Nazis.

## TODO

Viewed as an instrumental tool, technology is not strictly separate from us but is coupled with our bodies. 
It serves as an extension of our psychic and physical systems, influencing our mode of being. 
Technology shapes our means of communication and our material realities; it expands realms of possibilities, but simultaneously, extinguishes pre-existing modes.

For instance, the advent of cars transformed city planning and construction, subsequently making car ownership a necessity in many regions. 
Email revolutionized workplace communication ethics, making interaction with emails obligatory. 
I consider it a privilege that my generation was among the last to grow up in a world free of the internet. 
Today's children face a barrage of constant distractions. Their desires and attention are funneled into a profit-driven abyss.

Once well-established, technology assumes a commanding role, guiding our modes of communication. 
It influences our everyday life, and if we aim to participate in society, there's no way to avoid it. 
We inhabit an age of disruption, where technology evolves so swiftly that it eludes thorough analysis. 
People are kept busy, constantly striving to keep up with an endless stream of news feeds competing for their attention. 
It becomes challenging to apply any narrative to their experiences. 
They can't fully comprehend what's happening; they merely move through their day, moment by moment. 
It's a disorienting state of existence. 
Time slips away without deep satisfaction; another day sacrificed to Instagram.

The danger lies in the incessant hustle. 
We need spaces that foster our real engagement with technology! 
It's crucial to understand how it influences us, how it transforms us, how it can aid us, and how it might harm us. 
Moreover, in a humane society, people should have the power to decide how and if technological progress should continue.


## The Essence of Technology

In *Being and Time* (1927) Heidegger argues *phenomenologically* that theoretical activities such as the natural sciences depend on views of time and space that narrow the understanding implicit in how we deal with the ordinary world of action and concern.
We cannot construct meaningful distance and direction, or understand the opportunities for action, from science’s neutral, mathematical understanding of space and time.
Indeed, this detached and "objective" scientific view of the world restricts our everyday understanding. 
Our ordinary use of things and our *concernful dealings* within the world are pathways to a more fundamental and more truthful understanding of man and being than the sciences provide; 
science flattens the richness of ordinary concern.

Later, Heidegger posits that technology both unveils and conceals, functioning as a clearing between paths where reality manifests in a certain light. 
The *essence of technology* (das *Gestell*) is in its manner of revealing and concealing. 
It is a way in which we encounter entities generally, including nature, ourselves, and, indeed, everything.
This implies that technological entities have their distinct form of presence, persistence, and relationships between parts and wholes. 
They have their unique ways of presenting themselves and the world in which they exist---technology is about dominance and control. 
However, the heart of the issue lies not in any specific machine, process, or resource. 
Instead, technology is *challenging* (*herausfordernd*): the way the *essence of technology* shapes our understanding of all things, and the existence of those things themselves---the all-encompassing manner in which we encounter and are encountered by the technological world.

>[Because of technology] all distances in time and space are shrinking [and] yet the hasty setting aside of all distances brings no nearness; for nearness does not consist in a small amount of distance. -- Martin Heidegger

We seem to have become nearly incapable of experiencing this nearness, let alone comprehending it, as all things increasingly manifest to us in a technological fashion: we perceive and interact with them as what Heidegger describes as a *standing reserve*, akin to supplies in a storeroom, items of inventory awaiting direction and mobilization, assembly and disassembly, positioning and dismissal. 
Everything presents itself merely as an energy source or as a subject for our orchestration. 
We even perceive human abilities as if they were merely instruments for technological procedures, as when a laborer becomes nothing more than a tool for production.
Leaders, planners, along with the rest of us, are mere human assets to be managed, reorganized, and discarded. 
Every single entity that manifests itself technologically thereby forfeits its unique autonomy and form. We dismiss, conceal, or simply fail to perceive, other potentialities.

The mode of revealing that prevails in modern technology does not manifest as a bringing forth in the sense of *poiesis* (*Gestalt*). 
Instead, the revealing that governs modern technology is a *challenging* (*Herausfordern*) one, which places an unreasonable demand on nature to provide energy that can be extracted and stored. 
It's important to note that, for Heidegger, the *challenge* precedes the unlocking, thus the *essence of technology* predates natural science. 
It was technological thinking that first understood nature in such a way that nature could be challenged to unlock its forces and energy.
Modern technology is a distraction from our state of *being-in-the-world* (*Befindlichkeit*), which is always contingent on a mood that Heidegger calls *Sorge*, i.e., signifying fear, worry, or care.

>Modern technology is not applied natural science, far more is modern natural science the application of the essence of technology. [Nature is therefore] the fundamental piece of inventory of the technological standing reserve---and nothing else. -- Martin Heidegger

The nature of *being-in-the-world* is such that we can never escape these concerns, but we frequently attempt to deny them. 
We distract ourselves from our worries, the primary of which is death, and consequently live inauthentically. 
Our relationship with technological tools, techniques, and devices can aid this distraction, diverting us from our fundamental experience and enticing us into a false sense of security. 
This can be dangerous if it impedes the lived awareness of our ultimate existence::

>beings in trouble in a world of uncertainty.

We become accustomed to the internet, smartphones, social media, platform economies, and the endless repetition of trivialities. As individuals, we can often feel powerless in the face of new technologies, and occasionally experience a lack of depth provided by the scattered and dissected elements of our existence. 
The *essence of technology* deprives us of experiencing nearness because to truly experience it, we must encounter things in their truth. 
No matter how deeply we believe that science will allow us to engage with reality in its actuality, science only provides us with representations of things.
It only ever encounters that which its manner of representation has previously admitted as a possible object for itself.

Today the representational character of the digital shapes the physical.
Speaking in Baudrillardian terms, through the colonization of the last frontier---our immediate consciousness---companies are constructing a virtual yet *hyper-realistic world* that suggests there is no truth behind it.
This process is evolving so rapidly that meaningful analysis becomes impossible.
Our children will navigate a "meta"-reality.
They won't believe that the world depicted on their screens and other devices is real---that is not the danger!
I also doubt that they will consciously believe the fake stories of this realm saturated by advertisement.
Instead they run the risk of becoming cynical; of perceiving the real world as virtual.
Threfore, they may consider everything as a scene to be observed, and all their actions as performances that can be captured and reviewed at any given moment.
This would deny them a live of moments and turn it into a plan for later presentations.
Kids sense the digital world in a peculiar, allusive, and meta-like state.
This is why their memes are perpetually ironic, detached, self-referential, and buried beneath twenty layers of irony; the truth is completely dead to them.
They look at a *postmodern* president and culture and ask: what on earth is this?
They see Coca Cola advertisements that are knowingly winking and smiling at them, and they see through this nonsense.

The *challenging* essence of technology implies that functioning things lead to more functioning things.
Everything is *challenged* to serve as a systematic resource for technological application, which we subsequently utilize as a resource for further application, perpetuating a cycle. 
For instance, we *challenge* land to produce coal, considering the land as nothing more than a coal deposit. 
The coal is then stockpiled, always ready to unleash the stored solar heat it contains, which is then called upon for warmth, which subsequently is commanded to yield steam whose pressure drives the wheels that sustain a factory's operations. 
The factories themselves are *challenged* to create tools through which machines are once again put into service and preserved. 
If a market exists (constructed by channeled desire, i.e., marketing), we will likely have to adapt to yet another technological illusion.
This chain does not move toward anything that has its own presence, but, instead, "only enters into its *circuit*", and is "regulating and securing" natural resources and energies in this never-ending fashion.
No one asked for the Metaverse, but we will built it anyways because we are *challenged* to do so.

>A success is that type of consequence that itself remains assigned to the yielding of further consequences. -- Martin Heidegger

Alternative ways of comprehending distance and time, beyond the increasingly precise and impartial measuring with rulers and clocks, start to elude us; 
they no longer appear to be modes of understanding but at best, indistinct poetic portrayals. 
While many critics of technology highlight its apparent dangers, Heidegger underscores a different type of peril: the potential of technology to obstruct us from hearing "the call of a more primal truth".
The issue is not solely that technology impedes our access to this sphere, but that it causes us to entirely forget the existence of this realm.
Nevertheless, Heidegger posits that by acknowledging this danger, we might be able to discern and then address what has been neglected. 
The realization of our essence as receptive to this sphere, and of technology as merely one avenue through which things can manifest, is the roadmap for keeping technology within its appropriate confines. 
The thought that unfolds the potential for a *turn* away from technology and towards its fundamental domain is the recognition of its hazard.

>But where the danger is, there grows also what saves. -- Friedrich Hölderlin


## unclear

We are no longer operating in a free market. 
Late-stage capitalism now features a new type of platform economy that resembles feudalism, where peasants work the land of the lords. 
We're in a situation where people don't have equal access to tools and technology and no longer maintain control. 
When a young person has an idea, they naturally approach a financier, perceiving it as the only way to get their product developed. 
Developers and entrepreneurs often start with a genuine desire to improve the world. 
They believe their contribution will benefit the world and empower not just them and their investors, but also some industry or consumer base. 
However, accepting funding from problematic sources often forces them into specific actions. 
Ultimately, on the stock market, business becomes gamified. 
Companies shift their focus away from their products and become preoccupied with competition---Bezos versus Sergey Brin versus Mark Zuckerberg.

Additionally, since the digital industry is characterized by non-scarcity, it had to introduce a new business logic that gathers, concentrates, and protects knowledge and information. 
Under the guise of improving customer services, this new business logic aims to provide consumers with exactly what they want. 
I would argue, however, that the goal is more about manipulating consumers into an endless cycle of mostly subpar consumer goods. 
Desire is produced, channeled, and confused.

We have to ask:

>Are we programmers, or are we programmed?

The customer of *Meta* is not the young girl using it to forge friendships. 
Rather, it's the company purchasing the girl's *social graph*. 
Who is *Uber*'s customer? It isn't the driver, though it should be. 
Nor is it the passenger, even though it could be. 
Instead, it's the shareholder, the investor. 
*Uber* isn't concerned about creating a robust, sustainable taxi industry.


The *essence of technology* is inherently challenging and tends to lead to domination. 
Moreover, specific technological tools are invariably based on certain values and intentions. 
If we opt to utilize a particular technology, we must understand these underlying values and intentions.

Does this technology empower the right people? 
Who is it emancipatory for? How does it alter our ways of thinking, feeling, and communicating? 
Is it beneficial to us? Who is in control of it? What are its intended goals? 
Does it truly function as anticipated? What new possibilities does it create? 
Does it harbor artistic potential? What existing realities does it dismantle?
Moreover, and perhaps most crucially, can we perceive it as more than just a tool? 
Can we appreciate it in its entirety---as it presents itself to us, without reducing it to its constituent parts, functions, and effects? I am a proponent of a culture of mindful engagement---a society of informed participants within the sphere of technology. 
A capable society should possess the authority to reject technological progress in favor of cultural advancement.
