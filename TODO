Even though computers and networks have turned on many people, these technologies have the potential to emancipate the citizen of our planet by being a tool to build genuine connections.
A musical performance constructs a timely space where one can experience collective connections.
Computer music slipped out of commercialization, for this alone it is interesting.
It is like being back in 1990, remembering the *fever dream* which might be the first step to finally realize it.
Therefore, to me, the *community of algorithmic composing* and *live coding* is a project to resist the looming assimilation and to find joy in a time of misery and despair because its community strides towards affirming differences of the living being while acting collectively and inclusive.
I hope that someday this little project will strengthen the effort.

 One institution where this erosion of diverse and critical thought can be observed is the university, especially in Europe. 
The Bologna process has standardized and commodified the education system. 
Students are permitted to think, but only so far as it leads to "productivity" in an economic sense -- to reproduce and comply with an unquestioned system of economic exploitation. 
More often than not, universities today teach emotionally detached students to memorize specific rules so they can apply them in their next exam to earn good grades.
It's alarming that one of the most common questions from first-semester students is: what will the exam look like? 
Is this topic relevant for the exam? 
Students demand a checklist of actions guaranteed to earn them an A. 
If possible, they will exploit the system to achieve this goal. 
Many students are not captivated by the vast playground of reality. 
Their interest lies not in the experience of learning and understanding, but in the end product -- the certificate that grants access to well-paying jobs. 
And let's not forget that the teachers of tomorrow are the students of today.

This is not to blame the students. 
They are merely players in a control system that demands their compliance. 
We have ceased to punish. 
Instead, the network of machines now filters and channels the stream of desires and possibilities. 
It seems impossible to deviate from this school-like system since the new generation of professors was nurtured within it. 
Today, education equates to consumption.

However, it would be unjust to claim that this path hasn't been met with substantial critique and calls for adjustment. 
There is, indeed, mounting pressure, but the resultant changes remain to be seen. 
When the collective's wellbeing relies on the altruism of unelected individuals to fund their research and education plans, democracy is either under threat or merely an illusion.
